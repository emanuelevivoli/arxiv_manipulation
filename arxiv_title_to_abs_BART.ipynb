    "#### In this notebook, we use [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) Transformer model to perform title generation from abstracts. BART is a sequence-to-sequence model where both the input and targets are text sequences. BART is commonly used for text summarization. In our case, we would want to summarize titles from abstracts."

All\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n \n\nversions: [{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Mon, 2 Apr 2007 19:18:42 GMT'}, {'version': 'v2', 'created': 'Tue, 24 Jul 2007 20:10:27 GMT'}] \n\nupdate_date: 2008-11-26 \n\nauthors_parsed: [['Bal√°zs', 'C.', ''], ['Berger', 'E.

It has beenshown in another paper how gauge theories have to be extended in general, ifthere is assumed the existence of a minimal length. In this paper thisgeneralization of the description of gauge theories is applied to the case ofYang-Mills theories with gauge group SU(N) to consider especially theapplication to the electroweak theory as it appears in the standard model. Themodifications of the lepton-, Higgs- and gauge field sector of the extendedLagrangian of the electroweak theory maintaining local gauge invariance under$SU(2)_L\\otimes U(1)_Y$ transformations are investigated. There appearadditional interaction terms between the leptons or the Higgs particlerespectively with the photon and the W- and Z-bosons as well as additionalself-interaction terms of these gauge bosons themselves. It is remarkable thatin the quark sector where the full gauge group of the standard model, $SU(3)_c\\otimes SU(2)_L\\otimes U(1)_Y$, has to be considered there arise coupling termsbetween the gluons und the W- and Z-bosons which means that the electroweaktheory is not separated from quantum chromodynamics anymore.\n\n\n\n"

The system is dubbed PAAI, plasma which is abelian, asymmetricand idealised. For a range of the hidden fine structure constant values and thevalue of mass of the lightest fermion the PAAI is argued to simulate DarkEnergy. Additional fermions from the same sector are shown to account for DarkMatter. Further, residual $X$-magnetic fields can mix with Maxwellelectromagnetism to provides the seed for cosmic-scale magnetic fields. Thusthe scenario can explain several cosmological puzzles from within the samehidden sector.\n\n\n\n"

We use a more correct dissipation model that accounts for themodification of the quasienergy spectrum caused by the driving. When thenatural frequency of the mechanical object oscillates periodically around itsmean value, the master equation with the improved dissipation model isexpressed using Floquet operators. We apply the corresponding master equationto model the laser cooling of the mechanical object. Using an adiabaticapproximation, an analytical expression for the number of excitations of themechanical oscillator can be obtained. We find that the number of excitationscan be lower than in the non-time-dependent case. Our results raise thepossibility of achieving lower temperatures for the mechanical object if itsnatural frequency can be controlled as a function of time\n\n\n\n"

We show that every graph in eachof the following classes has a tree decomposition and a linear-sized pathdecomposition with bounded intersections: (1) every proper minor-closed class,(2) string graphs with a linear number of crossings in a fixed surface, (3)graphs with linear crossing number in a fixed surface. Here `linear size' meansthat the total size of the bags in the path decomposition is $O(n)$ for$n$-vertex graphs. We then show that every $n$-vertex graph that has a treedecomposition and a linear-sized path decomposition with bounded intersectionshas $O(\\sqrt{n})$ treewidth. As a corollary, we conclude a new lower bound onthe crossing number of a graph in terms of its treewidth. Finally, we considergraph classes that have two path decompositions with bounded intersections.Trees and outerplanar graphs have this property. But for the next most simpleclass, series parallel graphs, we show that no such result holds.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Natural gaits of the non-pathological flat foot and high-arched foot\n\nPredicted Title: A 3D Foot Scanner System for Human Walking\n\nAbstract:   There has been a controversy as to whether or not the non-pathological flatfoot and high-arched foot have an effect on human walking activities. The 3Dfoot scanning system was employed to obtain static footprints from subjectsadopting a half-weight-bearing stance. Based upon their footprints, thesubjects were divided into two groups: the flat-footed and the high-arched. Theplantar pressure measurement system was used to measure and record thesubjects' successive natural gaits. Two indices were proposed: distribution ofvertical ground reaction force (VGRF) of plantar and the rate of the footprintareas. Using these two indices to compare the natural gaits of the two subjectgroups, we found that (1) in stance phase, there is a significant difference(p<0.01) in the distributions of VGRF of plantar; (2) in a stride cycle, thereis also a significant difference (p<0.01) in the rates of the footprint areas.Our analysis suggests that when walking, the VGRF of the plantar brings greatermuscle tension to the flat-footed while a smaller rate of the footprint areasbrings greater stability to the high-arched.\n\n\n\n"

This paper analyzes users' rights into ten broad principles, as a basisfor assessing what users regard as important and for comparing differentmulti-issue Internet policy proposals. Stability of the principles isdemonstrated in an experimental survey, which also shows that freedoms of usersto participate in the design and coding of platforms appear to be viewed asinessential relative to other rights. An analysis of users' rights frameworksthat have emerged over the past twenty years similarly shows that suchproposals tend to leave out freedoms related to software platforms, as opposedto user data or public networks. Evaluating policy frameworks in a comparativeanalysis based on prior principles may help people to see what is missing andwhat is important as the future of the Internet continues to be debated.\n\n\n\n"

Importantly, auxiliary control over spatial phase modulation opens up away to guide topologically protected edge modes along generated virtualboundaries.

      "\nTrue Title: Usable Speech Assignment for Speaker Identification under Co-Channel\n  Situation\n\nPredicted Title: Model-Based Speaker Assignment System for Co-channel Speech\n\nAbstract:   Usable speech criteria are proposed to extract minimally corrupted speech forspeaker identification (SID) in co-channel speech. In co-channel speech, eitherspeaker can randomly appear as the stronger speaker or the weaker one at atime. Hence, the extracted usable segments are separated in time and need to beorganized into speaker streams for SID.

      "\nTrue Title: Procedures for the relative calibration of the SiPM gain on ASTRI SST-2M\n  camera\n\nPredicted Title: Gain Calibration on ASTRI SST-2M\n\nAbstract:   ASTRI SST-2M is one of the prototypes of the small size class of telescopesproposed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Its optical design is based on adual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder configuration, and the camera is composed by amatrix of monolithic multipixel silicon photomultipliers managed by ad-hoctailored front-end electronics. This paper describes the procedures for thegain calibration on the ASTRI SST-2M. Since the SiPM gain depends on theoperative voltage and the temperature, we adjust the operative voltages for allsensors to have equal gains at a reference temperature. We then correct gainvariations caused by temperature changes by adjusting the operating voltage ofeach sensor. For that purpose the SiPM gain dependence on operating voltage andon temperature have been measured. In addition, we present the calibrationprocedures and the results of the experimental measurements to evaluate, foreach pixel, the parameters necessary to make the trigger uniform over the wholefocal plane.\n\n\n\n"

To this end, we introduce a new class of problems that werefer to as two-stage stochastic submodular optimization models.

The author and colleagueshave previously shown that data for the surface brightness of disk galaxies arecompatible with a static universe with redshift linearly proportional todistance at all z (SEU hypothesis). In this paper we examine the moreconventional hypothesis that the universe is expanding, but that the actualradii of galaxies of a given luminosity increase with time (decrease with z),as others have proposed. We show that the radii data for both disk andelliptical galaxies are incompatible with any of the published size-evolutionpredictions based on an expanding universe. We find that all the physicalmechanisms proposed for size evolution, such as galaxy mergers, lead topredictions that are in quantitative contradiction with either the radius dataor other data sets, such as the observed rate of galaxy mergers. In addition,we find that when the effect of telescope resolution is taken into account, ther-z relationships for disk and elliptical galaxies are identical. Both areexcellently fit by SEU predictions. An overall comparison of cosmologicalmodels requires examining all available data-sets, but for this data-set thereis a clear contradiction of predictions based on an expanding universehypothesis.\n\n\n\n"

This paper focuses on the density-velocity dynamics. The Zeldovichapproximation implies that the three tensors are proportional; theproportionality constant is set by demanding `no decaying modes'. We extendthis condition into the non-linear regime and find that the eigenvalues of thegravity Hessian and the velocity derivative tensor are related as ${\\tilde q}_d+ {\\tilde q}_v=1$, where the triaxiality parameter ${\\tilde q} =(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{inter}})/(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}} -\\lambda_{\\mathrm{min}})$. This is a {\\it new universal relation} holding trueover all redshifts and a range of mass scales to within a few percent accuracy.The mean density-velocity divergence relation at late times is close to linear,indicating that the dynamics is dictated by collapse along the largesteigendirection. This relation has a scatter, which we show, is intimatelyconnected to the velocity shear. Finally, as an application, we compute thePDFs of the two variables and compare with other forms in the literature.\n\n\n\n"

To cope with those, three commonmethods are widely considered: (1) jointly estimating the parameters ofinterest and the nuisance parameters, (2) projecting out the nuisanceparameters, (3) selecting a reference and then taking differences between thereference and the observations, which we will refer to as \"differential signalprocessing.\" A lot of literature has been devoted to these methods, yet allfollow separate paths.  Based on a unified framework, we analytically explore the relations betweenthese three methods, where we particularly focus on the third one and introducea general differential approach to cope with multiple distinct nuisanceparameters. After a proper whitening procedure, the corresponding best linearunbiased estimators (BLUEs) are shown to be all equivalent to each other.Accordingly, we unveil some surprising facts, which are in contrast to what iscommonly considered in literature, e.g., the reference choice is actually notimportant for the differencing process. Since this paper formulates the problemin a general manner, one may specialize our conclusions to any particularapplication.

This provides an absolute measure of the total mass of gas uptakeas a function of time, which can be used to model the kinetic processesinvolved. The technique can measure diffusion parameters of gases in metalsclose to room temperature at gas pressures much below one atmosphere, asrelevant to surface processes such as atomic layer deposition and model studiesof heterogeneous catalysis, whereas traditional diffusion measurements requiretemperatures over 400oC at gas pressures of at least a few Torr. A strongaspect of the method is the ability to combine the bulk measurement of absorbedmass by a QCM with a surface-sensitive technique such as Auger electronspectroscopy in the same vacuum chamber. The method is illustrated using atomicoxygen, formed under O2 gas at 6x10-5 Torr in the presence of a hot tungstenfilament, interacting with the gold electrode on a QCM crystal held at 52 to120oC. Some of the incident oxygen forms a surface oxide which eventuallyblocks more uptake, and the rest, about 80%, indiffuses. Surprisingly, the rateof oxygen uptake initially increases with the amount of oxygen previouslyabsorbed; therefore, the measured oxygen uptake with time is reproducible onlyif pre-adsorption of oxygen conditions the sample. Temperatures above 130oC arenecessary for measurable thermal desorption, but all the oxygen can be removedby CO scavenging at all temperatures of these experiments. Simple kineticmodels are developed for fitting the experimental data to extract relevantparameters.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: PAMPC: Perception-Aware Model Predictive Control for Quadrotors\n\nPredicted Title: Pervasive Model Predictive Control for Quadrotors\n\nAbstract:   We present the first perception-aware model predictive control framework forquadrotors that unifies control and planning with respect to action andperception objectives. Our framework leverages numerical optimization tocompute trajectories that satisfy the system dynamics and require controlinputs within the limits of the platform. Simultaneously, it optimizesperception objectives for robust and reliable sens- ing by maximizing thevisibility of a point of interest and minimizing its velocity in the imageplane. Considering both perception and action objectives for motion planningand control is challenging due to the possible conflicts arising from theirrespective requirements. For example, for a quadrotor to track a referencetrajectory, it needs to rotate to align its thrust with the direction of thedesired acceleration. However, the perception objective might require tominimize such rotation to maximize the visibility of a point of interest. Amodel-based optimization framework, able to consider both perception and actionobjectives and couple them through the system dynamics, is therefore necessary.Our perception-aware model predictive control framework works in areceding-horizon fashion by iteratively solving a non-linear optimizationproblem. It is capable of running in real-time, fully onboard our lightweight,small-scale quadrotor using a low-power ARM computer, to- gether with avisual-inertial odometry pipeline. We validate our approach in experimentsdemonstrating (I) the contradiction between perception and action objectives,and (II) improved behavior in extremely challenging lighting conditions.\n\n\n\n"

Accordingly, efficient reasoningfor corresponding constraints in SMT theory solvers is highly relevant. Wepropose a new incomplete but efficient and terminating method to identifysatisfiable instances. The method is derived from the subtropical methodrecently introduced in the context of symbolic computation for computing realzeros of single very large multivariate polynomials. Our method takes as inputconjunctions of strict polynomial inequalities, which represent more than 40%of the QF_NRA section of the SMT-LIB library of benchmarks. The method takes anabstraction of polynomials as exponent vectors over the natural numbers taggedwith the signs of the corresponding coefficients. It then uses, in turn, SMT tosolve linear problems over the reals to heuristically find suitable points thattranslate back to satisfying points for the original problem. Systematicexperiments on the SMT-LIB demonstrate that our method is not a sufficientlystrong decision procedure by itself but a valuable heuristic to use within aportfolio of techniques.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution with\n  ensemble-based memories\n\nPredicted Title: An alternative approach to quantum key distribution\n\nAbstract:   Quantum memories are enabling devices for extending the reach of quantum keydistribution (QKD) systems. The required specifications for memories are,however, often considered too demanding for available technologies. One canchange this mindset by introducing memory-assistedmeasurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD), which imposes less stringentconditions on the memory modules. It has been shown that, in the case of {\\emfast} single-qubit memories, we can reach rates and distances not attainable bysingle no-memory QKD links. Single-qubit memories, such as single atoms orions, have, currently, too slow of an access time to offer an advantage inpractice. Here, we relax that assumption, and consider ensemble-based memories,which satisfy the main two requirements of having short access times and largestorage-bandwidth products. Our results, however, suggest that themultiple-excitation effects in such memories can be so detrimental that theymay wash away the scaling improvement offered by memory-equipped systems. Wethen propose an alternative setup that can in principle remedy the aboveproblem. As a prelude to our main problem, we also obtain secret key generationrates for MDI-QKD systems that rely on imperfect single-photon sources withnonzero probabilities of emitting two photons.\n\n\n\n"

However, the operations do not preserve the spatialrelationships in the learned representations. Hence, CNNs cannot extrapolate tovarious geometric transformations of inputs. Recently, Capsule Networks(CapsNets) have been proposed to tackle this problem. In CapsNets, each entityis represented by a vector and routed to high-level entity representations by adynamic routing algorithm. CapsNets have been shown to be more robust than CNNsto affine transformations of inputs. However, there is still a huge gap betweentheir performance on transformed inputs compared to untransformed versions. Inthis work, we first revisit the routing procedure by (un)rolling its forwardand backward passes. Our investigation reveals that the routing procedurecontributes neither to the generalization ability nor to the affine robustnessof the CapsNets. Furthermore, we explore the limitations of capsuletransformations and propose affine CapsNets (Aff-CapsNets), which are morerobust to affine transformations. On our benchmark task, where models aretrained on the MNIST dataset and tested on the AffNIST dataset, ourAff-CapsNets improve the benchmark performance by a large margin (from 79% to93.21%), without using any routing mechanism.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Cyclic structure induced by load fluctuations in adaptive transportation\n  networks\n\nPredicted Title: Tree-like transport networks under fluctuating flow\n\nAbstract:   Transport networks are crucial to the functioning of natural systems andtechnological infrastructures. For flow networks in many scenarios, such asrivers or blood vessels, acyclic networks (i.e., trees) are optimal structureswhen assuming time-independent in- and outflow. Dropping this assumption,fluctuations of net flow at source and/or sink nodes may render the pure treesolutions unstable even under a simple local adaptation rule for conductances.Here, we consider tree-like networks under the influence of spatiallyheterogeneous distribution of fluctuations, where the root of the tree issupplied by a constant source and the leaves at the bottom are equipped withsinks with fluctuating loads. We find that the network divides into two regionscharacterized by tree-like motifs and stable cycles. The cycles emerge throughtranscritical bifurcations at a critical amplitude of fluctuation. For a simplenetwork structure, depending on parameters defining the local adaptation,cycles first appear close to the leaves (or root) and then appear closertowards the root (or the leaves). The interaction between topology and dynamicsgives rise to complex feedback mechanisms with many open questions in thetheory of network dynamics. A general understanding of the dynamics in adaptivetransport networks is essential in the study of mammalian vasculature, andadaptive transport networks may find technological applications inself-organizing piping systems.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Multi-phase IRC Botnet and Botnet Behavior Detection Model\n\nPredicted Title: Identification of IRC Botnets and Botnets using C&C responses messages\n\nAbstract:   Botnets are considered one of the most dangerous and serious security threatsfacing the networks and the Internet. Comparing with the other securitythreats, botnet members have the ability to be directed and controlled via C&Cmessages from the botmaster over common protocols such as IRC and HTTP, or evenover covert and unknown applications. As for IRC botnets, general securityinstances like firewalls and IDSes do not provide by themselves a viablesolution to prevent them completely. These devices could not differentiate wellbetween the legitimate and malicious traffic of the IRC protocol. So, thispaper is proposing an IDS-based and multi-phase IRC botnet and botnet behaviordetection model based on C&C responses messages and malicious behaviors of theIRC bots inside the network environment. The proposed model has been evaluatedon five network traffic traces from two different network environments (Virtualnetwork and DARPA 2000 Windows NT Attack Data Set). The results show that theproposed model could detect all the infected IRC botnet member(s), state theircurrent status of attack, filter their malicious IRC messages, pass the othernormal IRC messages and detect the botnet behavior regardless of the botnetcommunication protocol with very low false positive rate. The proposed modelhas been compared with some of the existing and well-known approaches,including BotHunter, BotSniffer and Rishi regarding botnet characteristicstaken in each approach. The comparison showed that the proposed model has madea progress on the comparative models by not to rely on a certain time window orspecific bot signatures.\n\n\n\n"

The question arises asto what extent existing networks can absorb additional fluctuating powerinjection without exceeding thermal limits. At the same time, the resultingpower flow characteristics call for revisiting classical approaches to linetemperature prediction. This paper presents a probabilistic modeling andsimulation methodology for estimating the occurrence of critical linetemperatures in the presence of fluctuating power flows. Cumbersome integrationof the dynamic thermal equations at each Monte Carlo simulation trial is spedup by a specific algorithm that makes use of a variance reduction techniqueadapted from the telecommunications field. The substantial reduction incomputational time allows estimations closer to real time, relevant toshort-term operational assessments. A case study performed on a single linemodel provides fundamental insights into the probability of hitting criticalline temperatures under given power flow fluctuations.

      "\nTrue Title: Nasal Patches and Curves for Expression-robust 3D Face Recognition\n\nPredicted Title: Nose Biometrics: A Novel N nasal Region-Based Face\n  Recognition Al\n\nAbstract:   The potential of the nasal region for expression robust 3D face recognitionis thoroughly investigated by a novel five-step algorithm. First, the nose tiplocation is coarsely detected and the face is segmented, aligned and the nasalregion cropped. Then, a very accurate and consistent nasal landmarkingalgorithm detects seven keypoints on the nasal region. In the third step, afeature extraction algorithm based on the surface normals of Gabor-waveletfiltered depth maps is utilised and, then, a set of spherical patches andcurves are localised over the nasal region to provide the feature descriptors.The last step applies a genetic algorithm-based feature selector to detect themost stable patches and curves over different facial expressions. The algorithmprovides the highest reported nasal region-based recognition ranks on the FRGC,Bosphorus and BU-3DFE datasets. The results are comparable with, and in manycases better than, many state-of-the-art 3D face recognition algorithms, whichuse the whole facial domain. The proposed method does not rely on sophisticatedalignment or denoising steps, is very robust when only one sample per subjectis used in the gallery, and does not require a training step for thelandmarking algorithm. https://github.com/mehryaragha/NoseBiometrics\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: SDCT-AuxNet$^{\\theta}$: DCT Augmented Stain Deconvolutional CNN with\n  Auxiliary Classifier for Cancer Diagnosis\n\nPredicted Title: SDCT-AuxNet: A deep learning architecture for the classification of\n  Acute\n\nAbstract:   Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a pervasive pediatric white blood cellcancer across the globe. With the popularity of convolutional neural networks(CNNs), computer-aided diagnosis of cancer has attracted considerableattention. Such tools are easily deployable and are cost-effective. Hence,these can enable extensive coverage of cancer diagnostic facilities. However,the development of such a tool for ALL cancer was challenging so far due to thenon-availability of a large training dataset. The visual similarity between themalignant and normal cells adds to the complexity of the problem. This paperdiscusses the recent release of a large dataset and presents a novel deeplearning architecture for the classification of cell images of ALL cancer. Theproposed architecture, namely, SDCT-AuxNet$^{\\theta}$ is a 2-module frameworkthat utilizes a compact CNN as the main classifier in one module and a KernelSVM as the auxiliary classifier in the other one. While CNN classifier usesfeatures through bilinear-pooling, spectral-averaged features are used by theauxiliary classifier. Further, this CNN is trained on the stain deconvolvedquantity images in the optical density domain instead of the conventional RGBimages. A novel test strategy is proposed that exploits both the classifiersfor decision making using the confidence scores of their predicted classlabels. Elaborate experiments have been carried out on our recently releasedpublic dataset of 15114 images of ALL cancer and healthy cells to establish thevalidity of the proposed methodology that is also robust to subject-levelvariability. A weighted F1 score of 94.8$\\%$ is obtained that is best so far onthis challenging dataset.\n\n\n\n"

If DM consists of Weakly Interacting MassiveParticles (WIMPs), such stars may be powered by DM annihilation during theearly phases of their evolutions. We study the pre-main sequence evolutions ofthe primordial star using a detailed stellar evolution code under theassumption that the annihilation of adiabatically contracted WIMPs DM withinthe star provides a sufficient energy to sustain the stellar equilibrium. Wefollow the evolution of accreting stars using several gas mass accretion ratesderived from cosmological simulations. We show that the stellar mass becomesvery large, up to 900 - 1000 M_sun when the star reaches the main-sequencephase for a reasonable set of model parameters such as DM particle mass and theannihilation cross section. During the dark star phase, the star expands over athousand solar-radii, while the surface temperature remains below 10^4 K. Theenergy generated by nuclear reactions is not dominant during this phase. Wealso study models with different gas mass accretion rates and the DM particlemasses. All our models for different DM particle masses pass the dark starphase. The final mass of the dark stars is essentially unchanged for DM mass ofm_DM <= 10 GeV. Gravitational collapse of the massive dark stars will leavemassive black holes with mass as large as 1000 M_sun in the early universe.\n\n\n\n"

This quasar, HSC J124353.93+010038.5, has an order ofmagnitude lower luminosity than do the other known quasars at z > 7. Therest-frame ultraviolet absolute magnitude is M1450 = -24.13 +/- 0.08 mag andthe bolometric luminosity is Lbol = (1.4 +/- 0.1) x 10^{46} erg/s. Its spectrumin the optical to near-infrared shows strong emission lines, and shows evidencefor a fast gas outflow, as the C IV line is blueshifted and there is indicationof broad absorption lines. The Mg II-based black hole mass is Mbh = (3.3 +/-2.0) x 10^8 Msun, thus indicating a moderate mass accretion rate with anEddington ratio 0.34 +/- 0.20. It is the first z > 7 quasar with sub-Eddingtonaccretion, besides being the third most distant quasar, known to date. Theluminosity and black hole mass are comparable to, or even lower than, thosemeasured for the majority of low-z quasars discovered by the Sloan Digital SkySurvey, and thus this quasar likely represents a z > 7 counterpart to quasarscommonly observed in the low-z universe.\n\n\n\n"

It is further assumed that variations in one ofthe parameters is linearly driven by variations in the other after a time delay$t_d$. It is shown that alternating lags will be observed for a range of $t_d$values. A phenomenological model based on this generic one is developed whichcan explain the amplitude and phase lag variation with energy of thefundamental and the next three harmonics of the 67 mHz QPO observed in GRS1915+105. The phenomenological model also predicts the variation of theBicoherence phase with energy, which can be checked by further analysis of theobservational data.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Enhancement and tunability of near-field radiative heat transfer\n  mediated by surface plasmon polaritons in thin plasmonic films\n\nPredicted Title: Thermal coupling between surface phonon polaritons and thin films\n  enhances near-field\n\nAbstract:   The properties of thermal radiation exchange between hot and cold objects canbe strongly modified if they interact in the near field where electromagneticcoupling occurs across gaps narrower than the dominant wavelength of thermalradiation. Using a rigorous fluctuational electrodynamics approach, we predictthat ultra-thin films of plasmonic materials can be used to dramaticallyenhance near-field heat transfer. The total spectrally integrated film-to-filmheat transfer is over an order of magnitude larger than between the samematerials in bulk form and also exceeds the levels achievable with polardielectrics such as SiC. We attribute this enhancement to the significantspectral broadening of radiative heat transfer due to coupling between surfaceplasmon polaritons (SPPs) on both sides of each thin film. We show that theradiative heat flux spectrum can be further shaped by the choice of thesubstrate onto which the thin film is deposited. In particular, substratessupporting surface phonon polaritons (SPhP) strongly modify the heat fluxspectrum owing to the interactions between SPPs on thin films and SPhPs of thesubstrate. The use of thin film phase change materials on polar dielectricsubstrates allows for dynamic switching of the heat flux spectrum betweenSPP-mediated and SPhP-mediated peaks.\n\n\n\n"

We introduce a general method for obtaining fuzzy geometric spaces via toricgeometry, and develop tools for engineering four-dimensional GUT models fromthis non-commutative setup. We obtain the chiral matter content and Yukawacouplings, and show that the theory has a finite Kaluza-Klein spectrum. Thevalue of 1/alpha_(GUT) is predicted to be equal to the number of fuzzy pointson the internal four-cycle S. This relation puts a non-trivial restriction onthe space of gauge theories that can arise as a limit of F-theory. By viewingthe seven-brane as tiled by D3-branes sitting at the N fuzzy points of thegeometry, we argue that this theory admits a holographic dual description inthe large N limit. We also entertain the possibility of constructing stringmodels with large fuzzy extra dimensions, but with a high scale for quantumgravity.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Improved Approximation Algorithms for Segment Minimization in Intensity\n  Modulated Radiation Therapy\n\nPredicted Title: Approximation of intensity matrices with arbitrarily many rows\n\nAbstract:   he segment minimization problem consists of finding the smallest set ofinteger matrices that sum to a given intensity matrix, such that each summandhas only one non-zero value, and the non-zeroes in each row are consecutive.This has direct applications in intensity-modulated radiation therapy, aneffective form of cancer treatment. We develop three approximation algorithmsfor matrices with arbitrarily many rows. Our first two algorithms improve theapproximation factor from the previous best of $1+\\log_2 h $ to (roughly) $3/2\\cdot (1+\\log_3 h)$ and $11/6\\cdot(1+\\log_4{h})$, respectively, where $h$ isthe largest entry in the intensity matrix. We illustrate the limitations of thespecific approach used to obtain these two algorithms by proving a lower boundof $\\frac{(2b-2)}{b}\\cdot\\log_b{h} + \\frac{1}{b}$ on the approximationguarantee. Our third algorithm improves the approximation factor from $2 \\cdot(\\log D+1)$ to $24/13 \\cdot (\\log D+1)$, where $D$ is (roughly) the largestdifference between consecutive elements of a row of the intensity matrix.Finally, experimentation with these algorithms shows that they perform wellwith respect to the optimum and outperform other approximation algorithms on77% of the 122 test cases we consider, which include both real world andsynthetic data.\n\n\n\n"

DDoS attacks target the resources of these services,lowering their ability to provide optimum usage of the network infrastructure.Due to the nature of cloud computing, the methodologies for preventing orstopping DDoS attacks are quite different compared to those used in traditionalnetworks.

In nature, it is found in rivers, oceans, deserts, and otherenvironments. In industry, it is found in petroleum pipelines conveying grains,in sewer systems, and in dredging lines, for example. This study investigatesexperimentally the transport of the grains of a granular bed sheared by aturbulent liquid flow. In our experiments, fully developed turbulent waterflows were imposed over a flat granular bed of known granulometry. Under thetested conditions, the grains were transported as bed load, i.e., they becameentrained by rolling and sliding over each other, forming a moving granularlayer. The present experiments were performed close to incipient bed load, acase for which experimental data on grains velocities are scarce. Distinct fromprevious experiments, an entrance length assured that the water stream over theloose bed was fully developed. At different water flow rates, the moving layerwas filmed using a high-speed camera, and the grains' displacements andvelocities were determined by post-processing the images with a numerical codedeveloped in the course of this study. The bed-load transport rate wasestimated and correlated to the water flow conditions.\n\n\n\n"

We begin with thethree-dimensional (3D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with an angular momentumrotation term and/or long-range dipole-dipole interaction, state thetwo-dimensional (2D) GPE obtained from the 3D GPE via dimension reduction underanisotropic external potential and review some dynamical laws related to the 2Dand 3D GPE. By introducing a rotating Lagrangian coordinate system, theoriginal GPEs are re-formulated to GPEs without the angular momentum rotationwhich is replaced by a time-dependent potential in the new coordinate system.We then cast the conserved quantities and dynamical laws in the new rotatingLagrangian coordinates. Based on the new formulation of the GPE for rotatingBECs in the rotating Lagrangian coordinates, a time-splitting spectral methodis presented for computing the dynamics of rotating BECs. The new numericalmethod is explicit, simple to implement, unconditionally stable and veryefficient in computation. It is spectral order accurate in space andsecond-order accurate in time, and conserves the mass in the discrete level.Extensive numerical results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency andaccuracy of the new numerical method. Finally, the numerical method is appliedto test the dynamical laws of rotating BECs such as the dynamics of condensatewidth, angular momentum expectation and center-of-mass, and to investigatenumerically the dynamics and interaction of quantized vortex lattices inrotating BECs without/with the long-range dipole-dipole interaction.\n\n\n\n"

While the leading order correction to theeffective wavenumber of the coherent wave is well established at dilute arealdensity ($n_0 $) of scatterers, in this paper the higher order dependence ofthe coherent wavenumber on $n_0$ is developed in several directions. Startingfrom the quasi-crystalline approximation (QCA) a consistent method is describedfor continuing the Linton and Martin formula, which is second order in $n_0$,to higher orders. Explicit formulas are provided for corrections to theeffective wavenumber up to O$(n_0^4)$. Then, using the QCA theory as a basis,generalized self consistent schemes are developed and compared with selfconsistent schemes using other dynamic effective medium theories. It is shownthat the Linton and Martin formula provides a closed self-consistent scheme,unlike some other approaches.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Using a high-stability quartz-crystal microbalance to measure and model\n  the chemical kinetics for gases in and on metals: oxygen in gold\n\nPredicted Title: Measurement of the mass of a gas in a high-stability quartz-crystal\n\n\nAbstract:   This paper describes the use of a high-stability quartz-crystal microbalance(QCM) to measure the mass of a gas absorbed on and in the metal electrode onthe quartz oscillator, when the gas pressure is low and the gas can beconsidered as rigidly attached to the metal, so viscosity effects arenegligible. This provides an absolute measure of the total mass of gas uptakeas a function of time, which can be used to model the kinetic processesinvolved. The technique can measure diffusion parameters of gases in metalsclose to room temperature at gas pressures much below one atmosphere, asrelevant to surface processes such as atomic layer deposition and model studiesof heterogeneous catalysis, whereas traditional diffusion measurements requiretemperatures over 400oC at gas pressures of at least a few Torr. A strongaspect of the method is the ability to combine the bulk measurement of absorbedmass by a QCM with a surface-sensitive technique such as Auger electronspectroscopy in the same vacuum chamber. The method is illustrated using atomicoxygen, formed under O2 gas at 6x10-5 Torr in the presence of a hot tungstenfilament, interacting with the gold electrode on a QCM crystal held at 52 to120oC. Some of the incident oxygen forms a surface oxide which eventuallyblocks more uptake, and the rest, about 80%, indiffuses. Surprisingly, the rateof oxygen uptake initially increases with the amount of oxygen previouslyabsorbed; therefore, the measured oxygen uptake with time is reproducible onlyif pre-adsorption of oxygen conditions the sample. Temperatures above 130oC arenecessary for measurable thermal desorption, but all the oxygen can be removedby CO scavenging at all temperatures of these experiments. Simple kineticmodels are developed for fitting the experimental data to extract relevantparameters.\n\n\n\n"

The crowding is caused by the presence of viscoelasticpolymers or non-viscoelastic disconnected monomers. Our simulations show thatthe translational, as well as rotational mean square displacements, have adistinctive three-step growth for fixed values of self-propulsion force, andsteadily increase with self-propulsion, irrespective of the nature of thecrowder. On the other hand, in the absence of crowders, the rotational dynamicsof the Janus probe is independent of self-propulsion force. On replacing therepulsive polymers with sticky ones, translational and rotational mean squaredisplacements of the Janus probe show a sharp drop. Since different faces of aJanus particle interact differently with the environment, we show that thedirection of self-propulsion also affects its dynamics. The ratio of long-timetranslational and rotational diffusivities of the self-propelled probe with afixed self-propulsion, when plotted against the area fraction of the crowders,passes through a minima and at higher area fraction merges to its value in theabsence of the crowder. This points towards the decoupling of translational androtational dynamics of the self-propelled probe at intermediate area fractionof the crowders. However, such translational-rotational decoupling is absentfor passive probes.\n\n\n\n"

Thiswork is motivated by the fact that the commonly used binary system votingmodels only assign each input system a global weight which is responsible forthe global impact of each input system on all translations. This preventsindividual systems with low system weights from having influence on the systemcombination output, although in some situations this could be helpful. Further,words which have only been seen by one or few systems rarely have a chance ofbeing present in the combined output. We train a local system voting model by aneural network which is based on the words themselves and the combinatorialoccurrences of the different system outputs.

In recent years, major breakthroughs havebeen made in a study of counting constraint satisfaction problems (or #CSPs).In particular, a computational complexity classification of bounded-degree#CSPs has been discovered for all degrees except for two, where the \"degree\" ofan input instance is the maximal number of times that each input variableappears in a given set of constraints. Despite the efforts of recent studies,however, a complexity classification of degree-2 #CSPs has eluded from ourunderstandings. This paper challenges this open problem and gives its partialsolution by applying two novel proof techniques--T_{2}-constructibility andparametrized symmetrization--which are specifically designed to handle\"arbitrary\" constraints under randomized approximation-preserving reductions.We partition entire constraints into four sets and we classify theapproximation complexity of all degree-2 #CSPs whose constraints are drawn fromtwo of the four sets into two categories: problems computable inpolynomial-time or problems that are at least as hard as #SAT. Our proofexploits a close relationship between complex-weighted degree-2 #CSPs andHolant problems, which are a natural generalization of complex-weighted #CSPs.\n\n\n\n"

However, the state-of-the-art performance of detecting suchimportant objects (esp. small objects) is far from satisfying the demand ofpractical systems. Large-scale, rich-diversity, and high-resolution datasetsplay an important role in developing better object detection methods to satisfythe demand. Existing public large-scale datasets such as MS COCO collected fromwebsites do not focus on the specific scenarios. Moreover, the popular datasets(e.g., KITTI and Citypersons) collected from the specific scenarios are limitedin the number of images and instances, the resolution, and the diversity. Toattempt to solve the problem, we build a diverse high-resolution dataset(called TJU-DHD). The dataset contains 115,354 high-resolution images (52%images have a resolution of 1624$\\times$1200 pixels and 48% images have aresolution of at least 2,560$\\times$1,440 pixels) and 709,330 labeled objectsin total with a large variance in scale and appearance. Meanwhile, the datasethas a rich diversity in season variance, illumination variance, and weathervariance. In addition, a new diverse pedestrian dataset is further built. Withthe four different detectors (i.e., the one-stage RetinaNet, anchor-free FCOS,two-stage FPN, and Cascade R-CNN), experiments about object detection andpedestrian detection are conducted. We hope that the newly built dataset canhelp promote the research on object detection and pedestrian detection in thesetwo scenes. The dataset is available at https://github.com/tjubiit/TJU-DHD.\n\n\n\n"

The mainidea would be to place software receiving borderline classifications bytraditional machine learning methods in an environment where uncertainty isadded, while software is analyzed by more time-consuming deep learning models.The goal of uncertainty would be to rate-limit actions of potential malwareduring the time consuming deep analysis. In this paper, we present a detaileddescription of the analysis and implementation of CHAMELEON, a framework forrealizing this uncertain environment for Linux. CHAMELEON offers twoenvironments for software: (i) standard - for any software identified as benignby conventional machine learning methods and (ii) uncertain - for softwarereceiving borderline classifications when analyzed by these conventionalmachine learning methods. The uncertain environment adds obstacles to softwareexecution through random perturbations applied probabilistically on selectedsystem calls. We evaluated CHAMELEON with 113 applications and 100 malwaresamples for Linux. Our results showed that at threshold 10%, intrusive andnon-intrusive strategies caused approximately 65% of malware to failaccomplishing their tasks, while approximately 30% of the analyzed benignsoftware to meet with various levels of disruption. With a dynamic, per-systemcall threshold, CHAMELEON caused 92% of the malware to fail, and only 10% ofthe benign software to be disrupted. We also found that I/O-bound software wasthree times more affected by uncertainty than CPU-bound software. Further, weanalyzed the logs of software crashed with non-intrusive strategies, and foundthat some crashes are due to the software bugs.\n\n\n\n"

Features in the stress evolution profile showedcorrelations with phase changes in the oxide, thus yielding data complementaryto in situ XRD studies on this material. The stress evolution showed a complexvariation with lithium concentration suggesting that the volume changesassociated with phase transformations in the oxide are not monotonicallyvarying functions of lithium concentration. The peak tensile stress in thecathode during oxide delithiation was approximately 1.5 MPa and the peakcompressive stress during oxide lithiation was about 6 MPa.

Both these theorems are based on a decomposition method ofindependent interest. We give analogous results for $K_{s,t}$-minor-freegraphs, which lead to improved bounds on generalised colouring numbers forthese classes.

      "\nTrue Title: Using a high-stability quartz-crystal microbalance to measure and model\n  the chemical kinetics for gases in and on metals: oxygen in gold\n\nPredicted Title: Measurement of the mass of a gas in a high-stability quartz-crystal\n\n\nAbstract:   This paper describes the use of a high-stability quartz-crystal microbalance(QCM) to measure the mass of a gas absorbed on and in the metal electrode onthe quartz oscillator, when the gas pressure is low and the gas can beconsidered as rigidly attached to the metal, so viscosity effects arenegligible. This provides an absolute measure of the total mass of gas uptakeas a function of time, which can be used to model the kinetic processesinvolved. The technique can measure diffusion parameters of gases in metalsclose to room temperature at gas pressures much below one atmosphere, asrelevant to surface processes such as atomic layer deposition and model studiesof heterogeneous catalysis, whereas traditional diffusion measurements requiretemperatures over 400oC at gas pressures of at least a few Torr. A strongaspect of the method is the ability to combine the bulk measurement of absorbedmass by a QCM with a surface-sensitive technique such as Auger electronspectroscopy in the same vacuum chamber. The method is illustrated using atomicoxygen, formed under O2 gas at 6x10-5 Torr in the presence of a hot tungstenfilament, interacting with the gold electrode on a QCM crystal held at 52 to120oC. Some of the incident oxygen forms a surface oxide which eventuallyblocks more uptake, and the rest, about 80%, indiffuses. Surprisingly, the rateof oxygen uptake initially increases with the amount of oxygen previouslyabsorbed; therefore, the measured oxygen uptake with time is reproducible onlyif pre-adsorption of oxygen conditions the sample. Temperatures above 130oC arenecessary for measurable thermal desorption, but all the oxygen can be removedby CO scavenging at all temperatures of these experiments. Simple kineticmodels are developed for fitting the experimental data to extract relevantparameters.\n\n\n\n"

Conventional vision CNNs aredriven by camera frames at constant sample rate, thus achieving a fixed latencyand power consumption tradeoff. This paper describes further work on the firstexperiments of a closed-loop robotic system integrating a CNN together with aDynamic and Active Pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) in a predator/prey scenario. TheDAVIS, mounted on the predator Summit XL robot, produces frames at a fixed 15Hz frame-rate and Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) histograms containing 5k ON andOFF events at a variable frame-rate ranging from 15-500 Hz depending on therobot speeds. In contrast to conventional frame-based systems, the latency andprocessing cost depends on the rate of change of the image. The CNN is trainedoffline on the 1.25h labeled dataset to recognize the position and size of theprey robot, in the field of view of the predator. During inference, combiningthe ten output classes of the CNN allows extracting the analog position vectorof the prey relative to the predator with a mean 8.7% error in angularestimation. The system is compatible with conventional deep learningtechnology, but achieves a variable latency-power tradeoff that adaptsautomatically to the dynamics. Finally, investigations on the robustness of thealgorithm, a human performance comparison and a deconvolution analysis are alsoexplored.\n\n\n\n"

E-Healthis greatly impacting on information distribution and availability within thehealth services, hospitals and to the public. E-health was introduced as thedeath of telemedicine, because - in the context of a broad availability ofmedical information systems that can interconnect and communicate -telemedicine will no longer exist as a specific field. The same could also besaid for any other traditional field in medical informatics, includinginformation systems and electronic patient records. E-health presents itself asa common name for all such technological fields. In this paper we focuses inmulti database by determined some sites and distributed it in Homogenous way.This will be followed by an illustrative example as related works.

The DIRNet consists of a convolutional neural network(ConvNet) regressor, a spatial transformer, and a resampler. The ConvNetanalyzes a pair of fixed and moving images and outputs parameters for thespatial transformer, which generates the displacement vector field that enablesthe resampler to warp the moving image to the fixed image. The DIRNet istrained end-to-end by unsupervised optimization of a similarity metric betweeninput image pairs. A trained DIRNet can be applied to perform registration onunseen image pairs in one pass, thus non-iteratively. Evaluation was performedwith registration of images of handwritten digits (MNIST) and cardiac cine MRscans (Sunnybrook Cardiac Data). The results demonstrate that registration withDIRNet is as accurate as a conventional deformable image registration methodwith substantially shorter execution times.\n\n\n\n"

In this work we experimentally compare twoquantum annealing correction codes in the setting of antiferromagnetic chains,using two different quantum annealing processors. The lower temperatureprocessor gives rise to higher success probabilities. The two codes differ in anumber of interesting and important ways, but both require four physical qubitsper encoded qubit. We find significant performance differences, which weexplain in terms of the effective energy boost provided by the respectiveredundantly encoded logical operators of the two codes. The code with thehigher energy boost results in improved performance, at the expense of a lowerdegree encoded graph. Therefore, we find that there exists an importanttradeoff between encoded connectivity and performance for quantum annealingcorrection codes.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Phase Space dynamics of triaxial collapse: Joint density-velocity\n  evolution\n\nPredicted Title: Density-velocity dynamics of ellipsoidal collapse\n\nAbstract:   We investigate the dynamics of triaxial collapse in terms of eigenvalues ofthe deformation tensor, the velocity derivative tensor and the gravity Hessian.Using the Bond-Myers model of ellipsoidal collapse, we derive a new set ofequations for the nine eigenvalues and examine their dynamics in phase space.The main advantage of this form is that it eliminates the complicated ellipticintegrals that appear in the axes evolution equations and is more natural wayto understand the interplay between the perturbations.  This paper focuses on the density-velocity dynamics. The Zeldovichapproximation implies that the three tensors are proportional; theproportionality constant is set by demanding `no decaying modes'. We extendthis condition into the non-linear regime and find that the eigenvalues of thegravity Hessian and the velocity derivative tensor are related as ${\\tilde q}_d+ {\\tilde q}_v=1$, where the triaxiality parameter ${\\tilde q} =(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{inter}})/(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}} -\\lambda_{\\mathrm{min}})$. This is a {\\it new universal relation} holding trueover all redshifts and a range of mass scales to within a few percent accuracy.The mean density-velocity divergence relation at late times is close to linear,indicating that the dynamics is dictated by collapse along the largesteigendirection. This relation has a scatter, which we show, is intimatelyconnected to the velocity shear. Finally, as an application, we compute thePDFs of the two variables and compare with other forms in the literature.\n\n\n\n"

Thisstudy demonstrates that this approach has the potential to be one of the bestspace-time trade-off methods, representing a joining link between punctual andsatellite fields of view. The inverse proportionality between soil moisture andgamma signal is theoretically derived taking into account a non-constantcorrection due to the presence of growing vegetation beneath the detectorposition. The gamma signal attenuation due to biomass is modelled with a MonteCarlo-based approach in terms of an equivalent water layer which thicknessvaries in time as the crop evolves during its life-cycle. The reliability andeffectiveness of this approach is proved through a 7 months continuousacquisition of terrestrial gamma radiation in a 0.4 ha tomato (Solanumlycopersicum) test field. We demonstrate that a permanent gamma stationinstalled at an agricultural field can reliably probe the water content of thetop soil only if systematic effects due to the biomass shielding are properlyaccounted for. Biomass corrected experimental values of soil water contentinferred from radiometric measurements are compared with gravimetric dataacquired under different soil moisture levels, resulting in an averagepercentage relative discrepancy of about 3% in bare soil condition and of 4%during the vegetated period. The temporal evolution of corrected soil watercontent values exhibits a dynamic range coherent with the soil hydraulicproperties in terms of wilting point, field capacity and saturation.\n\n\n\n"

To conduct distance-measurement, two devicesexchange signals and, knowing these signals propagate at the speed of light,the time of arrival is used for distance estimations. Existingdistance-measurement techniques are incapable of protecting against adversarialdistance enlargement---a highly devastating tactic in which the adversaryreissues a delayed version of the signals transmitted between devices, afterdistorting the authentic signal to prevent the receiver from identifying it.The adversary need not break crypto, nor compromise any upper-layer securityprotocols for mounting this attack. No known solution currently exists toprotect against distance enlargement. We present \\textit{Ultra-WidebandEnlargement Detection} (UWB-ED), a new modulation technique to detect distanceenlargement attacks, and securely verify distances between two mutually trusteddevices. We analyze UWB-ED under an adversary that injects signals toblock/modify authentic signals. We show how UWB-ED is a good candidate for802.15.4z Low Rate Pulse and the 5G standard.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Magnetic absorption of VHE photons in the magnetosphere of the Crab\n  pulsar\n\nPredicted Title: The Crab pulsar magnetosphere: constraints on the emission site\n  of VHE photons\n\nAbstract:   The detection of the pulsed $\\sim 1 $~TeV gamma-ray emission from the Crabpulsar reported by MAGIC and VERITAS collaborations demands a substantialrevision of existing models of particle acceleration in the pulsarmagnetosphere. In this regard model independent restrictions on the possibleproduction site of the VHE photons become an important issue. In this paper, weconsider limitations imposed by the process of conversion of VHE gamma raysinto $e^{\\pm}$ pairs in the magnetic field of the pulsar magnetosphere. Photonswith energies exceeding 1~TeV are effectively absorbed even at large distancesfrom the surface of the neutron star. Our calculations of magnetic absorptionin the force-free magnetosphere show that the twisting of the magnetic fielddue to the pulsar rotation makes the magnetosphere more transparent compared tothe dipole magnetosphere. The gamma-ray absorption appears stronger for photonsemitted in the direction of rotation than in the opposite direction. There is asmall angular cone inside which the magnetosphere is relatively transparent andphotons with energy $1.5$~TeV can escape from distances beyond $0.1$~lightcylinder radius ($R_{\\rm{lc}}$). The emission surface from where photons can beemitted in the observer's direction further restricts the sites of VHEgamma-ray production. For the observation angle $57^{\\circ}$ relative to theCrab pulsar axis of rotation and the orthogonal rotation, the emission surfacein the open field line region is located as close as $0.4\\,R_{\\rm{lc}}$ fromthe stellar surface for a dipole magnetic field, and $0.1\\,R_{\\rm{lc}}$ for aforce-free magnetic field.\n\n\n\n"

That interior is matchedacross its surface to an asymptotically flat vacuum exterior. Perturbations aretaken to second order around a static and spherically symmetric backgroundconfiguration. Apart from the explicit assumptions, the perturbed configurationis constructed upon some implicit premises, in particular the continuity of thefunctions describing the perturbation in terms of some background radialcoordinate. In this work we revisit the model within a modern general andconsistent theory of perturbative matchings to second order, which isindependent of the coordinates and gauges used to describe the two regions tobe joined. We explore the matching conditions up to second order in full. Themain particular result we present is that the radial function $m_0$ (in thesetting of the original work) of the second order perturbation tensor, contraryto the original assumption, presents a jump at the surface of the star, whichis proportional to the value of the energy density of the backgroundconfiguration there. As a consequence, the change in mass needed by theperturbed configuration to keep the value of the central energy densityunchanged must be amended. We also discuss some subtleties that arise whenstudying the deformation of the star.\n\n\n\n"

It is shown that the unification of gauge couplingsinto a unique coupling constant can be achieved at a high-energy scalecompatible with proton decay constraints. This requires the addition of aminimal particle content at intermediate energy scales. In particular, theintroduction of the SU(2)_L triplets belonging to the (15,1)+(\\bar{15},1)representations, as well as of the scalar triplet \\Sigma_3 and octet \\Sigma_8in the (24,1) representation, turns out to be crucial for unification. Themasses of these intermediate particles can vary over a wide range, and even liein the TeV region. In contrast, the exotic vector-like fermions must be heavyenough and have masses above 10^10 GeV. We also show that, if the SU(5)xSU(5)theory is embedded into a heterotic string scenario, it is not possible toachieve gauge coupling unification with gravity at the perturbative stringscale.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Longitudinal and transversal flow over a cavity containing a second\n  immiscible fluid\n\nPredicted Title: Analytical solution for flow field of a shear flow over a cavity\n  containing a second\n\nAbstract:   An analytical solution for the flow field of a shear flow over a rectangularcavity containing a second immiscible fluid is derived. While flow of asingle-phase fluid over a cavity is a standard case investigated in fluiddynamics, flow over a cavity which is filled with a second immiscible fluid,has received little attention. The flow filed inside the cavity is consideredto define a boundary condition for the outer flow which takes the form of aNavier slip condition with locally varying slip length. The slip-lengthfunction is determined from the related problem of lid-driven cavity flow.Based on the Stokes equations and complex analysis it is then possible toderive a closed analytical expression for the flow field over the cavity forboth the transversal and the longitudinal case. The result is a comparativelysimple function, which displays the dependence of the flow field on the cavitygeometry and the medium filling the cavity. The analytically computed flowfield agrees well with results obtained from a numerical solution of theNavier-Stokes equations. The studies presented in this article are ofconsiderable practical relevance, for example for the flow oversuperhydrophobic surfaces.\n\n\n\n"

The objects wereidentified as SNR candidates in X-ray observations performed during the surveyof the LMC with XMM-Newton.  Methods: Data obained with XMM-Newton are used to investigate themorphological and spectral features of the remnants in X-rays. We measure theplasma conditions, look for supernova (SN) ejecta emission, and constrain someof the SNR properties (e.g. age and ambient density). We supplement the X-raydata with optical, infrared, and radio-continuum archival observations, whichallow us to understand the conditions resulting in the current appearance ofthe remnants. Based on the spatially-resolved star formation history (SFH) ofthe LMC together with the X-ray spectra, we attempt to type the supernovae thatcreated the remnants.  Results: We confirm all four objects as SNRs, to which we assign the namesMCSNR J0508-6830, MCSNR J0511-6759, MCSNR J0514-6840, and MCSNR J0517-6759. Inthe first two remnants, an X-ray bright plasma is surrounded by very faint [SII] emission. The emission from the central plasma is dominated by Fe L-shelllines, and the derived iron abundance is greatly in excess of solar. Thisestablishes their type Ia (i.e. thermonuclear) SN origin. They appear to bemore evolved versions of other Magellanic Cloud iron-rich SNRs which arecentrally-peaked in X-rays. From the two other remnants (MCSNR J0514-6840 andMCSNR J0517-6759), we do not see ejecta emission. At all wavelengths at whichthey are detected, the local environment plays a key role in theirobservational appearance. We present evidence that MCSNR J0517-6759 is close toand interacting with a molecular cloud, suggesting a massive progenitor.\n\n\n\n"

Nonexistence of collaborative systems betweenVRUs and vehicles was the main reason for this lack of attention. Recentdevelopments in Wi-Fi Direct and DSRC-enabled smartphones are changing thisperspective. Leveraging the existing V2V platforms, we propose a new frameworkusing a DSRC-enabled smartphone to extend safety benefits to VRUs. Theinteroperability of applications between vehicles and portable DSRC enableddevices is achieved through the SAE J2735 Personal Safety Message (PSM).However, considering the fact that VRU movement dynamics, response times, andcrash scenarios are fundamentally different from vehicles, a specific frameworkshould be designed for VRU safety applications to study their performance. Inthis article, we first propose an end-to-end Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P)framework to provide situational awareness and hazard detection based on themost common and injury-prone crash scenarios. The details of our VRU safetymodule, including target classification and collision detection algorithms, areexplained next. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a mitigating solution forcongestion and power consumption issues in such systems. Finally, the wholesystem is implemented and analyzed for realistic crash scenarios.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: A Sampling Theory Perspective of Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning\n\nPredicted Title: Bandlimited Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Classification\n\nAbstract:   Graph-based methods have been quite successful in solving unsupervised andsemi-supervised learning problems, as they provide a means to capture theunderlying geometry of the dataset. It is often desirable for the constructedgraph to satisfy two properties: first, data points that are similar in thefeature space should be strongly connected on the graph, and second, the classlabel information should vary smoothly with respect to the graph, wheresmoothness is measured using the spectral properties of the graph Laplacianmatrix. Recent works have justified some of these smoothness conditions byshowing that they are strongly linked to the semi-supervised smoothnessassumption and its variants. In this work, we reinforce this connection byviewing the problem from a graph sampling theoretic perspective, where classindicator functions are treated as bandlimited graph signals (in theeigenvector basis of the graph Laplacian) and label prediction as a bandlimitedreconstruction problem. Our approach involves analyzing the bandwidth of classindicator signals generated from statistical data models with separable andnonseparable classes. These models are quite general and mimic the nature ofmost real-world datasets. Our results show that in the asymptotic limit, thebandwidth of any class indicator is also closely related to the geometry of thedataset. This allows one to theoretically justify the assumption ofbandlimitedness of class indicator signals, thereby providing a samplingtheoretic interpretation of graph-based semi-supervised classification.\n\n\n\n"

However, consimilaritytransformations imply a physically unrealistic antilinear time-reversaloperation. This is just one of the approaches found in literature to thedescription of transformations where the role of conjugation has beenmisunderstood. In this paper, the different approaches are examined inparticular in respect to the role of conjugation. In order to justify andcorrectly derive the congruential rule for polarization basis transformationand properly place the role of conjugation, the origin of the problem is tracedback to the derivation of the antenna hight from the transmitted field. Infact, careful consideration of the role played by the Green's dyadic operatorrelating the antenna height to the transmitted field shows that, under generalunitary basis transformation, it is not justified to assume a scalarrelationship between them. Invariance of the voltage equation shows thatantenna states and wave states must in fact lie in dual spaces, a distinctionnot captured in conventional Jones vector formalism. Introducing spinorformalism, and with the use of an alternate spin frame for the transmittedfield a mathematically consistent implementation of the directional waveformalism is obtained. Examples are given comparing the wider generality of thecongruential rule in both active and passive transformations with theconsimilarity rule.\n\n\n\n"

We describe anoptimized atomic gravitational wave interferometric sensor (AGIS), whosesensitivity is proportional to the baseline length to power of 5/2, as opposedto the linear scaling of a more conservative design. Technical challenges arebriefly discussed, as is a table-top demonstrator AGIS that is presently underconstruction at Berkeley. We study a range of potential sources ofgravitational waves visible to AGIS, including galactic and extra-galacticbinaries. Based on the predicted shot noise limited performance, AGIS should becapable of detecting type Ia supernovae precursors within 500 pc, up to 200years beforehand. An optimized detector may be capable of detecting waves fromRX J0806.3+1527.\n\n\n\n"

We show that, when entering the regime of large fluctuations, onlya tiny, dramatically decaying fraction of the total information content remainsaccessible through the extraction of the full series of moments of the field.This is due to a known peculiarity of highly tailed distributions, that theycannot be uniquely recovered given the values of all of their moments. Thisrenders under this lognormal assumption cosmological probes such as thecorrelation function hierarchy or equivalently their Fourier transformsfundamentally limited once the field becomes non linear, for any parameter ofinterest. We show that the fraction of the information accessible fromtwo-point correlations decays to zero following the inverse squared variance ofthe field. We discuss what general properties of a random field's probabilitydensity function are making the correlation function hierarchy an efficient orinefficient, complete or incomplete set of probes of any model parameter.\n\n\n\n"

Based on acorrelation representation, we obtain a characterizing non-local Stein operatorwhich boils down to classical Stein operators in specific examples. Thanks tothis characterizing operator, we introduce various extensions of size bias andzero bias distributions and prove that these notions are closely linked toinfinite divisibility. Combined with standard Fourier techniques, theseextensions also allow obtaining explicit rates of convergence for compoundPoisson approximation in particular towards the symmetric $\\alpha$-stabledistribution. Finally, in the setting of non-degenerate self-decomposable laws,by semigroup techniques, we solve the Stein equation induced by thecharacterizing non-local Stein operator and obtain quantitative bounds in weaklimit theorems for sums of independent random variables going back to the workof Khintchine and L\\'evy.\n\n\n\n"

We derive the constraint propagationequations, discuss the behavior of constraint damping, and present the resultsof numerical tests using the gauge-wave and polarized Gowdy wave spacetimes.The construction of the $C^2$-adjusted system is straightforward. However, inBSSN, there are two kinetic constraints and three algebraic constraints; thus,the definition of $C^2$ is a matter of concern. By analyzing constraintpropagation equations, we conclude that $C^2$ should include all theconstraints, which is also confirmed numerically. By tuning the parameters, thelifetime of the simulations can be increased as 2-10 times as longer than thoseof the standard BSSN evolutions.\n\n\n\n"

With this scheme, the curse of dimensionality problem isreduced, compared to existing predictor based LPV subspace identificationschemes. The investigated LPV-SS model is reformulated into an equivalentimpulse response form, which turns out to be a moving average with exogenousinputs (MAX) system. The Markov coefficient functions of the LPV-MAXrepresentation are multi-linear in the scheduling signal and its time-shifts,contrary to the predictor based schemes where the corresponding LPVauto-regressive with exogenous inputs system is multi-quadratic in thescheduling signal and its time-shifts. In this paper, we will prove that undercertain conditions on the input and scheduling signals, the $\\ell_2$ lossfunction of the one-step-ahead prediction error for the LPV-MAX model has onlyone unique minimum, corresponding to the original underlying system. Hence,identifying the LPV-MAX model in the prediction error minimization frameworkwill be consistent and unbiased. The LPV-SS model is realized by applying anefficient basis reduced Ho-Kalman realization on the identified LPV-MAX model.The performance of the proposed scheme is assessed on a Monte Carlo simulationstudy.\n\n\n\n"

Besides the localization of flare producing areas the present workintends to reveal the characteristic temporal variations in these regions priorto flares. This study uses sunspot data instead of magnetograms, it follows thebehaviour of a suitable defined proxy measure representing the horizontalmagnetic field gradient. The source of the data is the SDD (SOHO/MDI-DebrecenData) sunspot catalogue. The most promising pre-flare signatures are thefollowing properties of the gradient variation: i) steep increase, ii) highmaximum, iii) significant fluctuation and iv) a gradual decrease between themaximum and the flare onset which can be related to the \"pull mode\" of thecurrent layer. These properties may yield a tool for the assessment of flareprobability and intensity within the next 8-10 hours.\n\n\n\n"

The paradigm has been extensively studied from variousaspects, including channel modeling and noise analysis. Comparatively littleattention has been given to the physical design of molecular receiver andtransmitter, envisioning biological synthetic cells with intrinsic molecularreception and transmission capabilities as the future nanomachines. However,this assumption leads to a discrepancy between the envisaged applicationsrequiring complex communication interfaces and protocols, and the very limitedcomputational capacities of the envisioned biological nanomachines. In thispaper, we examine the feasibility of designing a molecular receiver, in aphysical domain other than synthetic biology, meeting the basic requirements ofnanonetwork applications. We first review the state-of-the-art biosensingapproaches to determine whether they can inspire a receiver design. We revealthat nanoscale field effect transistor based electrical biosensor technology(bioFET) is a particularly useful starting point for designing a molecularreceiver. Focusing on bioFET-based molecular receivers with a conceptualapproach, we provide a guideline elaborating on their operation principles,performance metrics and design parameters. We then provide a simple model forsignal flow in silicon nanowire (SiNW) FET-based molecular receiver. Lastly, wediscuss the practical challenges of implementing the receiver and present thefuture research avenues from a communication theoretical perspective.\n\n\n\n"

Weextend basic thread algebra with the barest mechanism for sequencing of threadsthat are taken for fragments. This mechanism, called poly-threading, supportsboth autonomous and non-autonomous thread selection in sequencing.

In this work we show how the knowledge of thequasi-normal mode spectrum of non-rotating wormhole models can be used toreconstruct the effective potential that appears in the perturbation equations.From this it is further possible to obtain the parameters that characterize thespecific wormhole model, which in this paper was chosen to be the one by Damourand Solodukhin. We also address the question whether one can distinguish suchtype of wormholes from ultra compact stars, if only the quasi-normal modespectrum is known. We have proven that this is not possible by using thetrapped modes only, but requires additional information.  The here presented inverse method is an extension of work that has previouslybeen developed and applied to the oscillation spectra of ultra compact starsand gravastars. However, it is not limited to the study of exotic compactobjects, but applicable to symmetric double barrier potentials that appear inone-dimensional wave equations. Therefore we think it can be of interest forother fields too.\n\n\n\n"

This paper pays attention to a special stochasticprocess, tempered fractional Langevin motion, which is non-Markovian andundergoes ballistic diffusion for long times. The corresponding time-changedLangevin system with inverse $\\beta$-stable subordinator is discussed indetail, including its diffusion type, moments, Klein-Kramers equation, and thecorrelation structure. Interestingly, this subordination could result in bothsubdiffusion and superdiffusion, depending on the value of $\\beta$. Thedifference between the subordinated tempered fractional Langevin equation andthe subordinated Langevin equation with external biasing force is studied for adeeper understanding of subordinator. The time-changed tempered fractionalBrownian motion by inverse $\\beta$-stable subordinator is also considered, aswell as the correlation structure of its increments. Some properties of thestatistical quantities of the time-changed process are discussed, displayingstriking differences compared with the original process.\n\n\n\n"

Here, a large set of nitrides have been designed, with their bandgap and alignment being studied by first-principles calculations combined withmachine learning. Band gap and band offset against wurtzite GaN accuratelycalculated by the combination of screened hybrid functional of HSE and DFT-PBEwere used to train and test machine learning models. After comparison amongdifferent techniques of machine learning, when elemental properties are takenas features, support vector regression (SVR) with radial kernel performs bestfor predicting both band gap and band offset with prediction root mean squareerror (RMSE) of 0.298 eV and 0.183 eV, respectively. The former is within HSEcalculation uncertainty and the latter is small enough to provide reliablepredictions. Additionally, when band gap calculated by DFT-PBE was added intothe feature space, band gap prediction RMSE decreases to 0.099 eV. Through afeature engineering algorithm, elemental feature space based band gapprediction RMSE further drops by around 0.005 eV and the relative importance ofelemental properties for band gap prediction was revealed. Finally, band gapand band offset of all designed nitrides were predicted and two trends werenoticed that as the number of cation types increases, band gap tends to narrowdown while band offset tends to go up. The predicted results will be a usefulguidance for precise investigation on nitride engineering.\n\n\n\n"

While non-linear transforms have been proposed to extract thisinformation lost to traditional methods, up to now, the way to generalize thesetechniques to discrete processes was unclear; ad hoc extensions had somesuccess. We pointed out in Carron and Szapudi (2013) that the logarithmictransform approximates extremely well the optimal \"sufficient statistics\",observables that extract all information from the (continuous) matter field.Building on these results, we generalize optimal transforms to discrete galaxyfields. We focus our calculations on the Poisson sampling of an underlyinglognormal density field. We solve and test the one-point case in detail, andsketch out the sufficient observables for the multi-point case. Moreover, wepresent an accurate approximation to the sufficient observables in terms of themean and spectrum of a non-linearly transformed field. We find that thecorresponding optimal non-linear transformation is directly related to themaximum a posteriori Bayesian reconstruction of the underlying continuous fieldwith a lognormal prior as put forward in Kitaura et al (2010). Thus simplerecipes for realizing the sufficient observables can be built on previouslyproposed algorithms that have been successfully implemented and tested insimulations.\n\n\n\n"

Part I involves an inertial frame where aregiven the analogues both of Boltzmann's derivation of the Stefan-Boltzmann lawand also Wien's derivation of the displacement theorem using the scaling ofrelativitic radiation theory. Next the spectrum of classical scalar zero-pointradiation in an inertial frame is derived both from scale invariance and fromLorentz invariance. Part II involves the behavior of thermal radiation in acoordinate frame undergoing (relativistic) constant acceleration, a Rindlerframe. The radiation normal modes in a Rindler frame are obtained. Theclassical zero-point radiation of inertial frames is transformed over to thecoordinates of a Rindler frame. Although for zero-point radiation the two-fieldcorrelation function at different spatial points at a single time is the samebetween inertial and Rindler frames, the correlation function at two differenttimes at a single Rindler spatial coordinate is different, and has a naturalextension to non-zero temperature. The thermal spectrum in the Rindler frame isthen transferred back to an inertial frame, giving the familar Planck spectrum.\n\n\n\n"

We selected 15,165 filaments at 0.2<z<0.6 ranging from30 Mpc to 100 Mpc in length, identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)survey. We stacked the X-ray count-rate maps from ROSAT around the filaments,excluding resolved galaxy groups and clusters above the mass of ~3 * 10^13 Msunas well as the detected X-ray point sources from the ROSAT, Chandra, andXMM-Newton observations. The stacked signal results in the detection of theX-ray emission from the cosmic filaments at a significance of 4.2 sigma in theenergy band of 0.56-1.21 keV. The signal is interpreted, assuming theAstrophysical Plasma Emission Code (APEC) model, as an emission from the hotgas in the filament-core regions with an average gas temperature of0.9(+1.0-0.6) keV and a gas overdensity of ~30 at the center of the filaments.Furthermore, we show that stacking the SRG/eROSITA data for ~2,000 filamentsonly would lead to a ~5 sigma detection of their X-ray signal, even with anaverage gas temperature as low as ~0.3 keV.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: ASR Context-Sensitive Error Correction Based on Microsoft N-Gram Dataset\n\nPredicted Title: Post-Editing Error Correction for Automatic Speech Recognition\n\nAbstract:   At the present time, computers are employed to solve complex tasks andproblems ranging from simple calculations to intensive digital image processingand intricate algorithmic optimization problems to computationally-demandingweather forecasting problems. ASR short for Automatic Speech Recognition is yetanother type of computational problem whose purpose is to recognize humanspoken speech and convert it into text that can be processed by a computer.Despite that ASR has many versatile and pervasive real-world applications,it isstill relatively erroneous and not perfectly solved as it is prone to producespelling errors in the recognized text, especially if the ASR system isoperating in a noisy environment, its vocabulary size is limited, and its inputspeech is of bad or low quality. This paper proposes a post-editing ASR errorcorrection method based on MicrosoftN-Gram dataset for detecting and correctingspelling errors generated by ASR systems. The proposed method comprises anerror detection algorithm for detecting word errors; a candidate correctionsgeneration algorithm for generating correction suggestions for the detectedword errors; and a context-sensitive error correction algorithm for selectingthe best candidate for correction. The virtue of using the Microsoft N-Gramdataset is that it contains real-world data and word sequences extracted fromthe web which canmimica comprehensive dictionary of words having a large andall-inclusive vocabulary. Experiments conducted on numerous speeches, performedby different speakers, showed a remarkable reduction in ASR errors. Futureresearch can improve upon the proposed algorithm so much so that it can beparallelized to take advantage of multiprocessor and distributed systems.\n\n\n\n"

In consequence,having one image of a plane symmetric object and a calibrated camera, we canautomatically have a second, virtual image of that object if the 3-D locationof the symmetry plane is known. In this work, we show for the first time thatthe above concept naturally extends to transmission imaging and present analgorithm to estimate the 3-D symmetry plane from a set of projection domainimages based on Grangeat's theorem. We then exploit symmetry to generate avirtual trajectory by mirroring views at the plane of symmetry. If the plane isnot perpendicular to the acquired trajectory plane, the virtual and realtrajectory will be oblique. The resulting X-shaped trajectory will bedata-complete, allowing for the compensation of in-plane motion using epipolarconsistency. We evaluate the proposed method on a synthetic symmetric phantomand, in a proof-of-concept study, apply it to a real scan of an anthropomorphichuman head phantom.\n\n\n\n"

Newmechanisms recommending video rate adaptation towards delivering enhancedQuality of Experience (QoE) at the same time making room for more sessions.This paper introduces a cross-layer QoE-aware architecture for video trafficover the Internet. It proposes that video sources at the application layeradapt their rate to the network environment by controlling their transmittedbit rate dynamically; and the edge of network at the network layer protects thequality of the active video sessions by controlling the acceptance of newsession through a video-aware admission control. In particular, it will seekthe most efficient way of accepting new video session and adapting transmissionrates to free up resources for more session while maintaining the QoE of activesessions. The proposed framework will contribute to the preparation for theextreme growth of video traffic in the foreseeable future. Simulation resultsshow that the proposed cross-layer architecture guarantees the QoE for theadmitted sessions and utilizes the link more efficiently comparing to the rateadaptation only architecture.\n\n\n\n"

Here, we have consideredthe simplest form of $f(R,T)$ i.e. $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$, where $R$ is the Ricciscalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy momentum tensor and explored thespatially homogeneous and anisotropic Locally Rotationally Symmetric (LRS)Bianchi type-I cosmological model. It is assumed that the Universe is filledwith two non-interacting matter sources namely scalar field (normal or phantom)with scalar potential and matter contribution due to $f(R,T)$ action. We havediscussed two cosmological models according to power law and exponential law ofthe volume expansion along with constant and exponential scalar potential assub models. Power law models are compatible with normal (quintessence) andphantom scalar field whereas exponential volume expansion models are compatiblewith only normal (quintessence) scalar field. The values of cosmologicalconstant in our models are in agreement with the observational results.Finally, we have discussed some physical and kinematical properties of both themodels.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Towards the Formal Reliability Analysis of Oil and Gas Pipelines\n\nPredicted Title: Higher-order-logic formalization of reliability analysis of pipelines\n  using series RBD\n\nAbstract:   It is customary to assess the reliability of underground oil and gaspipelines in the presence of excessive loading and corrosion effects to ensurea leak-free transport of hazardous materials. The main idea behind thisreliability analysis is to model the given pipeline system as a ReliabilityBlock Diagram (RBD) of segments such that the reliability of an individualpipeline segment can be represented by a random variable. Traditionally,computer simulation is used to perform this reliability analysis but itprovides approximate results and requires an enormous amount of CPU time forattaining reasonable estimates. Due to its approximate nature, simulation isnot very suitable for analyzing safety-critical systems like oil and gaspipelines, where even minor analysis flaws may result in catastrophicconsequences. As an accurate alternative, we propose to use ahigher-order-logic theorem prover (HOL) for the reliability analysis ofpipelines. As a first step towards this idea, this paper provides ahigher-order-logic formalization of reliability and the series RBD using theHOL theorem prover. For illustration, we present the formal analysis of asimple pipeline that can be modeled as a series RBD of segments withexponentially distributed failure times.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Cascade Seesaw for Tiny Neutrino Mass\n\nPredicted Title: Neutrino Mass from a Dimension-5+4n Operator\n\nAbstract:   The accessibility to physics responsible for tiny neutrino mass suggests thatthe mass should better originate from certain higher dimensional operators. Theconventional three types of seesaw operate at dimension five with the help ofeither a new fermion or scalar multiplet. Here we propose a seesaw thatgenerates neutrino mass through a dimension-(5+4n) operator. The seesaw isfunctioned by a fermion of isospin n+1 and zero hypercharge and a sequence ofscalar multiplets that share unity hypercharge but have isospin from 3/2 ton+1/2 at a step of unity. Only the scalar of the highest isospin can couple tothe relevant fermions while only the scalar of the lowest isospin can directlydevelop a naturally small vacuum expectation value (VEV). The VEV is thentransmitted to scalars of higher isospin through a cascading process. No globalsymmetry is required to forbid lower dimensional operators. A neutrino mass ofdesired order can thus be induced with a relatively low seesaw scale withoutdemanding too small couplings.\n\n\n\n"

The ETD($\\lambda$) algorithm wasrecently proposed by Sutton, Mahmood, and White to solve a long-standingdivergence problem of the standard TD algorithm when it is applied tooff-policy training, where data from an exploratory policy are used to evaluateother policies of interest. The almost sure convergence of ETD($\\lambda$) hasbeen proved in our recent work under general off-policy training conditions,but for a narrow range of diminishing stepsize. In this paper we presentconvergence results for constrained versions of ETD($\\lambda$) with constantstepsize and with diminishing stepsize from a broad range. Our resultscharacterize the asymptotic behavior of the trajectory of iterates produced bythose algorithms, and are derived by combining key properties of ETD($\\lambda$)with powerful convergence theorems from the weak convergence methods instochastic approximation theory. For the case of constant stepsize, in additionto analyzing the behavior of the algorithms in the limit as the stepsizeparameter approaches zero, we also analyze their behavior for a fixed stepsizeand bound the deviations of their averaged iterates from the desired solution.These results are obtained by exploiting the weak Feller property of the Markovchains associated with the algorithms, and by using ergodic theorems for weakFeller Markov chains, in conjunction with the convergence results we get fromthe weak convergence methods. Besides ETD($\\lambda$), our analysis also appliesto the off-policy TD($\\lambda$) algorithm, when the divergence issue is avoidedby setting $\\lambda$ sufficiently large.\n\n\n\n"

When trained to predict thesatisfiability of toy problems, it was shown to find solutions andunsatisfiable cores on its own. However, the authors saw \"no obvious path\" tousing the architecture to improve the state-of-the-art. In this work, we traina simplified NeuroSAT architecture to directly predict the unsatisfiable coresof real problems.

Themodified MiniSat solves 10% more problems on SAT-COMP 2018 within the standard5,000 second timeout than the original does. The modified Glucose solves 11%more problems than the original, while the modified Z3 solves 6% more. Thegains are even greater when the training is specialized for a specificdistribution of problems; on a benchmark of hard problems from a schedulingdomain, the modified Glucose solves 20% more problems than the original doeswithin a one-hour timeout. Our results demonstrate that NeuroSAT can provideeffective guidance to high-performance SAT solvers on real problems.\n\n\n\n"

The continuum model consists of anequation for the motion of grain boundaries (i.e., motion of the constituentdislocations in the grain boundary normal direction) and equations for thedislocation structure evolution on the grain boundaries. This model is derivedfrom the discrete dislocation dynamics model. The long-range elasticinteraction between dislocations is included in the continuum model, whichensures that the dislocation structure on a grain boundary is consistent withthe Frank's formula. These evolution of the grain boundary and its dislocationstructure are able to describe both normal motion and tangential translation ofthe grain boundary and grain rotation due to both coupling and sliding. Sincethe continuum model is based upon dislocation structure, it naturally accountsfor the grain boundary shape change during the motion and rotation of the grainboundary by motion and reaction of the constituent dislocations. Using thederived continuum grain boundary dynamics model, simulations are performed forthe dynamics of circular and non-circular two dimensional grain boundaries, andthe results are validated by discrete dislocation dynamics simulations.\n\n\n\n"

Hydrogen is a unique element that possess positive, negative orneutral oxidation state in solids depending upon the chemical environment. Ifone can find hydrogen storage materials where hydrogen is present in bothnegative and positive oxidation state within the same structural framework thenone can accommodate hydrogen with high volume density. So, it is fundamentallyas well as technologically important to identify compounds in which hydrogen isin amphoteric nature and understand the necessary criteria for its origin. Theexperimental structural analysis of Cyclotriborazane and Diammonium dodecahydro-closo-dodecaborate insinuate the presence of hydrogen with anionic andcationic behavior within the same structure. In order to understand the role ofvan der Waals (vdW) interactions on structural parameters, we have considered12 different vdW corrected functionals and found that the optPBE-vdW functionalpredicts the equilibrium structural parameters reliably with less than 0.009 %accuracy. So, the optPBE-vdW functional is used to calculate charge density,electron localization function, total as well as the partial density of state,Bader and Born effective charge etc. We have observed that hydrogen isexhibiting amphoteric behavior with H closer to B in the negatively chargedstate and that neighboring to N is in a positively charged state.\n\n\n\n"

Finally, sufficientconditions for Paley-Wiener type perturbation of weaving $K$-frames are given.\n\n\n\n"

The process$Y^D$ defined by $Y^D_t=W^D_{S_t}$ is called a subordinate killed Brownianmotion.

We first show that non-negative harmonic functions of $Y^D$ satisfy thescale invariant Harnack inequality. Subsequently we prove two types of scaleinvariant boundary Harnack principles with explicit decay rates fornon-negative harmonic functions of $Y^D$. The first boundary Harnack principledeals with a $C^{1,1}$ domain $D$ and non-negative functions which are harmonicnear the boundary of $D$, while the second one is for a more general domain $D$and non-negative functions which are harmonic near the boundary of an interioropen subset of $D$. The obtained decay rates are not the same, reflectingdifferent boundary and interior behaviors of $Y^D$.\n\n\n\n"

It owes its popularity toits simplicity and computational efficiency, rather than its ability torepresent specific polymers species and conditions. Here we show, that bytuning the chain stiffness it is possible to adapt the KG model to model meltsof real polymers. In particular, we provide mapping relations from KG to SIunits for a wide range of commodity polymers. The connection between theexperimental and the KG melts is made at the Kuhn scale, i.e. at the crossoverfrom chemistry-specific small scale to the universal large scale behavior. Weexpect Kuhn scale-mapped KG models to faithfully represent universal propertiesdominated by the large scale conformational statistics and dynamics of flexiblepolymers. In particular, we observe very good agreement between entanglementmoduli of our KG models and the experimental moduli of the target polymers.\n\n\n\n"

In particular, we ask: which binding freeenergies of the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product reaction intermediatesminimize the fraction of enzymes sequestered in complexes, while sustaining ata certain minimal flux? Under reasonable biophysical assumptions, we find thatthe optimal design will saturate the bound on the minimal flux, and reflects abasic trade-off in catalytic operation. If both binding free energies are toohigh, there is low sequestration, but the effective progress of the reaction ishampered. If both binding free energies are too low, there is highsequestration, and the reaction flux may also be suppressed in extreme cases.The optimal binding free energies are therefore neither too high nor too low,but in fact moderate. Moreover, the optimal difference in substrate and productbinding free energies, which contributes to the thermodynamic driving force ofthe reaction, is in general strongly constrained by the intrinsic free-energydifference between products and reactants. Both the strategies of using anegative binding free-energy difference to drive the catalyst-bound reactionforward, and of using a positive binding free-energy difference to enhancedetachment of the product, are limited in their efficacy.\n\n\n\n"

Forexample, multisets are non-free data types because the multiset $\\{a,b,b\\}$ hastwo other equivalent but literally different forms $\\{b,a,b\\}$ and $\\{b,b,a\\}$.Pattern matching is known to provide a handy tool set to treat such data types.Although many studies on pattern matching and implementations for practicalprogramming languages have been proposed so far, we observe that none of thesestudies satisfy all the criteria of practical pattern matching, which are asfollows: i) efficiency of the backtracking algorithm for non-linear patterns,ii) extensibility of matching process, and iii) polymorphism in patterns.  This paper aims to design a new pattern-matching-oriented programminglanguage that satisfies all the above three criteria. The proposed languagefeatures clean Scheme-like syntax and efficient and extensible pattern matchingsemantics. This programming language is especially useful for the processing ofcomplex non-free data types that not only include multisets and sets but alsographs and symbolic mathematical expressions. We discuss the importance of ourcriteria of practical pattern matching and how our language design naturallyarises from the criteria. The proposed language has been already implementedand open-sourced as the Egison programming language.\n\n\n\n"

Despite of the use of RGB and optical flowframes, the I3D model (amongst others) thrives on combining its output with theImproved Dense Trajectory (IDT) and extracted with its low-level videodescriptors encoded via Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Fisher Vectors (FV). Such afusion of CNNs and handcrafted representations is time-consuming due topre-processing, descriptor extraction, encoding and tuning parameters. Thus, wepropose an end-to-end trainable network with streams which learn the IDT-basedBoW/FV representations at the training stage and are simple to integrate withthe I3D model. Specifically, each stream takes I3D feature maps ahead of thelast 1D conv. layer and learns to `translate' these maps to BoW/FVrepresentations. Thus, our model can hallucinate and use such synthesizedBoW/FV representations at the testing stage. We show that even features of theentire I3D optical flow stream can be hallucinated thus simplifying thepipeline. Our model saves 20-55h of computations and yields state-of-the-artresults on four publicly available datasets.\n\n\n\n"

In acute care, the branchof medicine encompassing the emergency department (ED) and intensive care units(ICU), error rates may be higher to due low situational awareness amongclinicians performing resuscitation on patients. To support cognition, noviceteam leaders may rely on reference guides to direct and anticipate futuresteps. However, guides often act as a fixation point, diverting the leader'sattention away from the team. To address this issue, we conducted a qualitativestudy that evaluates a collaborative cognitive aid co-designed with clinicianscalled Visual TASK. Our study explored the use of Visual TASK in threesimulations employing a projected shared display with two different interactionmodalities: the Microsoft Kinect and a touchscreen. Our results suggest thattools like the Kinect, while useful in other areas of acute care like the OR,are unsuitable for use in high-stress situations like resuscitation. We alsoobserved that fixation may not be constrained to reference guides alone, andmay extend to other objects in the room. We present our findings, and adiscussion regarding future avenues in which collaborative cognitive aids mayhelp in improving situational awareness in resuscitation.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: On the model-dependence of the relation between minimum-bias and\n  inelastic proton-proton cross sections\n\nPredicted Title: The sensitivity of minimum-bias triggers to proton-proton cross sections\n\nAbstract:   The model-dependence of the relation between the inelastic and variousminimum-bias proton-proton cross sections is analyzed, paying a specialattention to the sensitivity of minimum-bias triggers to diffractivecollisions. Concentrating on the trigger selections of the ATLAS experiment,the measured cross sections are compared to predictions of a number of hadronicMonte Carlo models used in the cosmic ray field. It is demonstrated that theATLAS results are able to discriminate between different models and betweencertain theoretical approaches for soft multi-particle production. On the otherhand, the strong model-dependence of the selection efficiency of theminimum-bias triggers prevents one from inferring high mass diffraction ratefrom the discussed data. Moreover, the measured cross sections prove to beinsensitive to the production of low mass diffractive states in proton-protoncollisions. Consequently, a reliable determination of the total inelastic crosssection requires forward proton tracking by a dedicated experiment.\n\n\n\n"

Confirming thescenario drawn in 1+1 dimensional systems, the transition is found to belong totwo different universality classes - Multiplicative Noise (MN) and DirectedPercolation (DP) - depending on the linear or nonlinear character of damagespreading occurring in the coupled systems. By comparing coupled map latticewith two different stochastic models, accurate numerical estimates for MN in2+1 dimensions are obtained. Finally, aiming to pave the way for futureexperimental studies, slightly non-identical replicas have been considered. Itis shown that the presence of small differences between the dynamics of the tworeplicas acts as an external field in the context of absorbing phasetransitions, and can be characterized in terms of a suitable critical exponent.\n\n\n\n"

In addition to thetrajectories of individual particles, we also study their drift and thecorresponding total drift areas in the F\\\"oppl and Kirchhoff potential flowmodels. Our findings, which are obtained numerically and in some regimes arealso supported by asymptotic analysis, are compared to the wakeless potentialflow which serves as a reference. We show that in the presence of the F\\\"opplvortex wake some of the particles follow more complicated trajectoriesfeaturing a second loop. The appearance of an additional stagnation point inthe F\\\"oppl flow is identified as a source of this effect. It is alsodemonstrated that, while the total drift area increases with the size of thewake for large vortex strengths, it is actually decreased for small circulationvalues. On the other hand, the Kirchhoff flow model is shown to have anunbounded total drift area. By providing a systematic account of the wakeeffects on the drift, the results of this study will allow for more accuratemodeling of hydrodynamic stirring.\n\n\n\n"

These requirements ask for a well-designed computing architecture tosupport the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of CV applications. Computation offloadingtechniques, such as cloud, edge, and fog computing, can help CVs processcomputation-intensive and large-scale computing tasks. Additionally, differentcloud/edge/fog computing architectures are suitable for supporting differenttypes of CV applications with highly different QoS requirements, whichdemonstrates the importance of the computing architecture design. However, mostof the existing surveys on cloud/edge/fog computing for CVs overlook thecomputing architecture design, where they (i) only focus on one specificcomputing architecture and (ii) lack discussions on benefits, researchchallenges, and system requirements of different architectural alternatives. Inthis paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on different architectural designalternatives based on cloud/edge/fog computing for CVs. The contributions ofthis paper are: (i) providing a comprehensive literature survey on existingproposed architectural design alternatives based on cloud/edge/fog computingfor CVs, (ii) proposing a new classification of computing architectures basedon cloud/edge/fog computing for CVs: computation-aided and computation-enabledarchitectures, (iii) presenting a holistic comparison among differentcloud/edge/fog computing architectures for CVs based on functional requirementsof CV systems, including advantages, disadvantages, and research challenges.\n\n\n\n"

Steady state or oscillatory results are obtained using doublemultiple-relaxation-time thermal lattice Boltzmann method. The velocity andtemperature fields are solved using D2Q9 and D2Q5 models, respectively. Withdifferent Rayleigh number, the tested natural convection can either achieve tosteady state or oscillatory. With fixed Rayleigh number, lower Prandtl numberleads to a weaker convection effect, longer oscillation period and higheroscillation amplitude for the cases reaching oscillatory solutions. At fixedPrandtl number, higher Rayleigh number leads to a more notable convectioneffect and longer oscillation period. Double multiple-relaxation-time thermallattice Boltzmann method is applied to simulate the low Prandtl number fluidnatural convection.

Our results give evidence that this is not always thecase. We conduct scans for the top 250,000 most visited domains on theInternet, from clients located at five different regions: Australia, Brazil,India, the UK, and the US. Our scans gather data from both application (URLsand HTTP headers) and transport (servers' selected TLS version, ciphersuite,and certificate) layers. Overall, we find that HTTPS inconsistencies at theapplication layer are higher than those at the transport layer. We also findthat HTTPS security inconsistencies are strongly related to URLs and IPsdiversity among regions, and to a lesser extent to the presence ofredirections. Further manual inspection shows that there are several reasonsbehind URLs diversity among regions such as downgrading to the plain-HTTPprotocol, using different subdomains, different TLDs, or different home pagedocuments. Furthermore, we find that downgrading to plain-HTTP is related towebsites' regional blocking. We also provide attack scenarios that show how anattacker can benefit from HTTPS security inconsistencies, and introduce a newattack scenario which we call the \"region confusion\" attack. Finally, based onour analysis and observations, we provide discussion, which include somerecommendations such as the need for testing tools for domain administratorsand users that help to mitigate and detect regional domains' inconsistencies,standardising regional domains format with the same-origin policy (of domains)in mind, standardising secure URL redirections, and avoid redirections wheneverpossible.\n\n\n\n"

The effect of the particles on such flows and vice-versa are highlynon-trivial and are not completely understood, particularly when the particlesare finite-sized. Here we report an experimental study of millimetric fibers ina strongly sheared turbulent flow. We find that the fibers show a preferredorientation of $-0.38\\pi \\pm 0.05\\pi$ ($-68 \\pm 9^\\circ$) with respect to themean flow direction in high-Reynolds number Taylor-Couette turbulence, for allstudied Reynolds numbers, fiber concentrations, and locations. Despite thefinite-size of the anisotropic particles, we can explain the preferentialalignment by using Jefferey's equation, which provides evidence of the benefitof a simplified point-particle approach. Furthermore, the fiber angularvelocity is strongly intermittent, again indicative of point-particle-likebehavior in turbulence. Thus large anisotropic particles still can retainsignatures of the local flow despite classical spatial and temporal filteringeffects.\n\n\n\n"

The paper develops high-orderaccurate physical-constraints-preserving (PCP) central discontinuous Galerkin(DG) methods for the one- and two-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic(RHD) equations with a general EOS. It is built on the theoretical analysis ofthe admissible states for the RHD and the PCP limiting procedure enforcing theadmissibility of central DG solutions. The convexity, scaling and orthogonalinvariance, and Lax-Friedrichs splitting property of the admissible state setare first proved with the aid of its equivalent form, and then the high-ordercentral DG methods with the PCP limiting procedure and strong stabilitypreserving time discretization are proved to preserve the positivity of thedensity, pressure, and specific internal energy, and the bound of the fluidvelocity, maintain the high-order accuracy, and be $L^1$-stable. The accuracy,robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated byseveral 1D and 2D numerical examples involving large Lorentz factor, strongdiscontinuities, or low density or pressure etc.\n\n\n\n"

Both models satisfy to main physical restrictions and leave nodoubts in the possibility to realize these particles experimentally.

      "\nTrue Title: Wave Climate from Spectra and its Connections with Local and Remote Wind\n  Climate\n\nPredicted Title: Spectral wave climate in the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean\n\nAbstract:   Because wind-generated waves can propagate over large distances, wave spectrafrom a fixed point can record information about air-sea interactions in distantareas. In this study, the spectral wave climate is computed for a specificlocation in the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean. Several well-defined partitionsindependent of each other, referred to as wave-climate systems, are observed inthe annual mean wave spectrum. Significant seasonal cycling, long-term trends,and correlations with climate indices are observed in the local wave spectra,showing the abundant climatic information they contain. The projections of thewind vector on the direction pointing to the target location are used to linkthe spectral wave climate and basin-scale wind climate. The origins of all theidentified wave climate systems are clearly shown in the wind projection mapsand some are thousands of kilometers away from the target point, demonstratingthe validity of this connection. Comparisons are made between wave spectra andthe corresponding local and remote wind fields with respect to seasonal andinterannual variability, as well as the long-term trends. The results show thateach frequency and direction of ocean wave spectra at a certain location can belinked to the wind field for a geographical area from a climatological point ofview, implying that it is feasible to reconstruct a spectral wave climate fromglobal observational wind field data and wind climate monitoring usingobservations of wave spectrum geographically far away.\n\n\n\n"

In this paper, we introduce abenchmark set of ten autotunable kernels for important computational problemsimplemented in OpenCL or CUDA. Using our Kernel Tuning Toolkit, we show thatwith autotuning most of the kernels reach near-peak performance on various GPUsand outperform baseline implementations on CPUs and Xeon Phis. Our evaluationalso demonstrates that autotuning is key to performance portability. Inaddition to offline tuning, we also introduce dynamic autotuning of codeoptimization parameters during application runtime. With dynamic tuning, theKernel Tuning Toolkit enables applications to re-tune performance-criticalkernels at runtime whenever needed, for example, when input data changes.Although it is generally believed that autotuning spaces tend to be too largeto be searched during application runtime, we show that it is not necessarilythe case when tuning spaces are designed rationally. Many of our kernels reachnear peak-performance with moderately sized tuning spaces that can be searchedat runtime with acceptable overhead. Finally we demonstrate, how dynamicperformance tuning can be integrated into a real-world application fromcryo-electron microscopy domain.\n\n\n\n"

The expression captures the singularity in closedform using standard functions and quickly convergent series. Applications toproblems involving contact between elastic spheres are discussed. An exactsolution for a point load on a sphere is presented and subsequently generalizedfor distributed loads. Examples for constant and Hertzian-type distributedloads are provided, where the latter is also compared to the Hertz contacttheory for identical spheres.

In our previous work [J. H. Cheng et al.,Nucl. Rhys. A 997, 121717 (2020)], we systematically studied the protonradioactivity half-lives of 53< Z <83 nuclei within the two-potential approachwith Skyrme-Hartree-Fock. The calculations can well reproduce the experimentaldata of spherical nuclei. The present work is an extension of the previouswork. We systematically study 32 proton radioactivity half-lives of sphericalnuclei with the two-potential approach with Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (TPA-SHF)within 115 different versions of the Skyrme interactions. The calculatedresults indicate that the SLy7 Skyrme interaction gives the lowest r.m.s.deviation in the description of the experimental data of the spherical protonemitters among all the different versions of the Skyrme interactions. Inaddition, we use this model with the SLy7 Skyrme interaction to predict theproton radioactivity half-lives of 7 spherical nuclei in the same region, whoseproton radioactivity is energetically allowed or has been observed but is notyet quantified.\n\n\n\n"

CME-induced dimming regions are foundto be characterized by significant blueshift and enhanced line width by using asingle Gaussian fit. While a red-blue (RB) asymmetry analysis and a RB-guideddouble Gaussian fit of the coronal line profiles indicate that these are likelycaused by the superposition of a strong background emission component and arelatively weak (~10%) high-speed (~100 km s-1) upflow component. This findingsuggests that the outflow velocity in the dimming region is probably of theorder of 100 km s-1, not ~20 km s-1 as reported previously. Density andtemperature diagnostics suggest that dimming is primarily an effect of densitydecrease rather than temperature change. The mass losses in dimming regions asestimated from different methods are roughly consistent with each other andthey are 20%-60% of the masses of the associated CMEs. With the guide of RBasymmetry analysis, we also find several temperature-dependent outflows (speedincreases with temperature) immediately outside the (deepest) dimming region.In an erupted CME loop and an EUV jet, profiles of emission lines formed atcoronal and transition region temperatures are found to exhibit twowell-separated components, an almost stationary component accounting for thebackground emission and a highly blueshifted (~200 km s-1) componentrepresenting emission from the erupting material. The two components can easilybe decomposed through a double Gaussian fit and we can diagnose the electrondensity, temperature and mass of the ejecta. Combining the speed of theblueshifted component and the projected speed of the erupting material derivedfrom simultaneous imaging observations, we can calculate the real speed of theejecta.\n\n\n\n"

In laboratory levitation experiments, we study how magnetic fields upto 7 mT influence the aggregation of dust by observing the self-consistentcollisional evolution of particle ensembles. As dust samples we use mixtures ofiron and quartz in different ratios. Without magnetic fields, particles in allsamples grow into a bouncing barrier. These aggregates reversibly form largerclusters in the presence of magnetic fields. The size of these clusters dependson the strength of the magnetic field and the ratio between iron and quartz.The clustering increases the size of the largest entities by a factor of a few.If planetesimal formation is sensitive to the size of the largest aggregates,e.g., relying on streaming instabilities, then planetesimals willpreferentially grow iron-rich in the inner region of protoplanetary disks.

      "\nTrue Title: Real-time microwave imaging of unknown anomalies via scattering matrix\n\nPredicted Title: An inverse scattering method for small and extended anomalies\n\nAbstract:   We consider an inverse scattering problem to identify the locations or shapesof unknown anomalies from scattering parameter data collected by a small numberof dipole antennas. Most of researches does not considered the influence ofdipole antennas but in the experimental simulation, they are significantlyaffect to the identification of anomalies. Moreover, opposite to thetheoretical results, it is impossible to handle scattering parameter data whenthe locations of the transducer and receiver are the same in real-worldapplication. Motivated by this, we design an imaging function with and withoutdiagonal elements of the so-called scattering matrix. This concept is based onthe Born approximation and the physical interpretation of the measurement datawhen the locations of the transducer and receiver are the same and different.We carefully explore the mathematical structures of traditional and proposedimaging functions by finding relationships with the infinite series of Besselfunctions of integer order. The explored structures reveal certain propertiesof imaging functions and show why the proposed method is better than thetraditional approach. We present the experimental results for small andextended anomalies using synthetic and real data at several angular frequenciesto demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique.\n\n\n\n"

It should be emphasized thatthis study contains both new results and literature surveys about some of therelated results that have existed so far. With the aid of hypergeometricfunction, generating functions for a new family of the combinatorial numbers,related to finite sums of powers of binomial coefficients, are constructed. Byusing these generating functions, a number of new identities have been obtainedand at the same time previously well-known formulas and identities have beengeneralized. Moreover, on this occasion, we identify new families ofpolynomials including some families of well-known numbers such as Bernoullinumbers, Euler numbers, Stirling numbers, Franel numbers, Catalan numbers,Changhee numbers, Daehee numbers and the others, and also for the polynomialssuch as the Legendre polynomials, Michael Vowe polynomial, the Mirimanoffpolynomial, Golombek type polynomials, and the others. We also give bothRiemann and $p$-adic integral representations of these polynomials. Finally, wegive combinatorial interpretations of these new families of numbers,polynomials and finite sums of the powers of binomial coefficients. We alsogive open questions for ordinary generating functions for these numbers.\n\n\n\n"

I.\n  Surveying the Stellar Content with HST/ACS\n\nPredicted Title: The M31 stellarpopulations: A survey of the red clumps and disk-\n\nAbstract:   We present the largest and most detailed survey to date of the stellarpopulations in the outskirts of M31 based on the analysis of 14 deep HST/ACSpointings spanning the range 11.5-45.0 kpc. We conduct a quantitativecomparison of the resolved stellar populations in these fields and identifyseveral striking trends. The color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), which reach ~3magnitudes below the red clump, can be classified into two main categoriesbased on their morphologies. `Stream-like' fields, so named for theirsimilarity to the CMD of the giant stellar stream, are characterized by a redclump that slants bluewards at fainter magnitudes and an extended horizontalbranch. On the other hand, `disk-like' fields exhibit rounder red clumps withsignificant luminosity width, lack an obvious horizontal branch and showevidence for recent star formation (~0.25 - 2.0 Gyr ago). We compare thespatial and line-of-sight distribution of stream-like fields with a recentsimulation of the giant stream progenitor orbit and find an excellentagreement. These fields, found across the face of M31, attest to the highdegree of pollution caused by this event. Disk-like material resides in theextended disk structure of M31 and is detected out to 44 kpc (projected); theuniform populations in these fields, including the ubiquitous presence of youngpopulations, and the strong rotation reported elsewhere are most consistentwith a scenario in which this structure has formed through heating anddisruption of the existing thin disk, perhaps due to the impact of the giantstream progenitor. Our comparative analysis sheds new light on the likelycomposition of two of the ultra-deep pointings formerly presented as pure outerdisk and pure halo in the literature.\n\n\n\n"

By conducting a comprehensiveexperiments, we have observed that such studies lack to consider very importantaspects of hybrid memories including the effect of: a) data migrations onperformance, b) data migrations on power, and c) the granularity of datamigration. This paper presents an efficient data migration scheme at theOperating System level in a hybrid DRAMNVM memory architecture. In the proposedscheme, two Least Recently Used (LRU) queues, one for DRAM section and one forNVM section, are used for the sake of data migration. With carefulcharacterization of the workloads obtained from PARSEC benchmark suite, theproposed scheme prevents unnecessary migrations and only allows migrationswhich benefits the system in terms of power and performance. The experimentalresults show that the proposed scheme can reduce the power consumption up to79% compared to DRAM-only memory and up to 48% compared to the state-of-the arttechniques.\n\n\n\n"

Here, a large set of nitrides have been designed, with their bandgap and alignment being studied by first-principles calculations combined withmachine learning. Band gap and band offset against wurtzite GaN accuratelycalculated by the combination of screened hybrid functional of HSE and DFT-PBEwere used to train and test machine learning models. After comparison amongdifferent techniques of machine learning, when elemental properties are takenas features, support vector regression (SVR) with radial kernel performs bestfor predicting both band gap and band offset with prediction root mean squareerror (RMSE) of 0.298 eV and 0.183 eV, respectively. The former is within HSEcalculation uncertainty and the latter is small enough to provide reliablepredictions. Additionally, when band gap calculated by DFT-PBE was added intothe feature space, band gap prediction RMSE decreases to 0.099 eV. Through afeature engineering algorithm, elemental feature space based band gapprediction RMSE further drops by around 0.005 eV and the relative importance ofelemental properties for band gap prediction was revealed. Finally, band gapand band offset of all designed nitrides were predicted and two trends werenoticed that as the number of cation types increases, band gap tends to narrowdown while band offset tends to go up. The predicted results will be a usefulguidance for precise investigation on nitride engineering.\n\n\n\n"

Although saliencydetection is well explored for 2D image and video content, there are only fewattempts made to design 3D saliency prediction models. Newly proposed 3D visualattention models have to be validated over large-scale video saliencyprediction datasets, which also contain results of eye-tracking information.There are several publicly available eye-tracking datasets for 2D image andvideo content. In the case of 3D, however, there is still a need forlarge-scale video saliency datasets for the research community for validatingdifferent 3D-VAMs. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset containingeye-tracking data collected from 61 stereoscopic 3D videos (and also 2Dversions of those) and 24 subjects participated in a free-viewing test. Weevaluate the performance of the existing saliency detection methods over theproposed dataset. In addition, we created an online benchmark for validatingthe performance of the existing 2D and 3D visual attention models andfacilitate addition of new VAMs to the benchmark. Our benchmark currentlycontains 50 different VAMs.\n\n\n\n"

Three cases are presented in this study: two inclined oblique shocks,here after IOS-1 and IOS-2, where the latter has a Mach number twice strongerthan the former. Both shocks have impact angles of 30$^o$ in relation to theSun-Earth line. Lastly, we choose a frontal perpendicular shock, FPS, whoseshock normal is along the Sun-Earth line, with the same Mach number as IOS-1.We find that, in the IOS-1 case, due to the north-south asymmetry, themagnetotail is deflected southward, leading to a mild compression. Thegeomagnetic activity observed in the nightside ionosphere is then weak. On theother hand, in the head-on case, the FPS compresses the magnetotail from bothsides symmetrically. This compression triggers a substorm allowing a largeramount of stored energy in the magnetotail to be released to the nightsideionosphere, resulting in stronger geomagnetic activity. By comparing IOS-2 andFPS, we find that, despite the IOS-2 having a larger Mach number, the FPS leadsto a larger geomagnetic response in the nightside ionosphere. As a result, weconclude that IP shocks with similar upstream conditions, such as magneticfield, speed, density, and Mach number, can have different geoeffectiveness,depending on their shock normal orientation.\n\n\n\n"

Builder wins the game if Painter is forced to make a monochromaticcopy of $H$ at some point in the game. Otherwise, Painter can avoid creating amonochromatic copy of $H$ forever, and we say Painter wins the game.  We initiate the study of characterizing the graphs $F$ such that for a givengraph $H$, Painter wins the online Ramsey game for $H$ on $F$-free graphs. Wecharacterize all graphs $F$ such that Painter wins the online Ramsey game for$C_3$ on the class of $F$-free graphs, except when $F$ is one particular graph.We also show that Painter wins the online Ramsey game for $C_3$ on the class of$K_4$-minor-free graphs, extending a result by Grytczuk, Ha{\\l}uszczak, andKierstead.\n\n\n\n"

This appliesespecially to those domains where highly iterative development and continuousintegration cannot be applied. Several approaches have been proposed to usemeasurement as a means to improve test effectiveness and efficiency. Most ofthem rely on using product data, historical data, or in-process data that isnot related to quality assurance ac- tivities. Very few approaches use datafrom early quality assurance activities such as inspection data in order tofocus testing activities and thereby reduce test effort. This article gives anoverview of potential benefits of using data from early defect detectionactivities, potentially in addition to other data, in order to focus testingactivities. In addition, the article sketches an integrated inspection andtesting process and its evaluation in the context of two case studies. Takingthe study limitations into account, the results show an overall reduction oftesting effort by up to 34%, which mirrors an efficiency improvement of up toabout 50% for testing.\n\n\n\n"

These four EM modes arise in aFabry-Perot cavity (FPC) when degenerate band edge (DBE) condition issatisfied. The modes interact constructively with the electron beam resultingin superior amplification. In particular, much larger gains are achieved forsmaller beam currents compared to conventional structures based onsynchronization with only a single EM mode. We demonstrate giant gain scalingwith respect to the length of the slow-wave structure compared to conventionalPierce type single mode traveling wave tube amplifiers. We construct a coupledtransmission line (CTL) model for a loaded waveguide slow-wave structureexhibiting a DBE, and investigate the phenomenon of giant gain via supersynchronization using the Pierce model generalized to multimode interaction.\n\n\n\n"

The classical Cornfieldcondition allows us to assess whether an unmeasured binary confounder canexplain away the observed relative risk of the exposure on the outcome. Itstates that for an unmeasured confounder to explain away an observed relativerisk, the association between the unmeasured confounder and the exposure, andalso that between the unmeasured confounder and the outcome, must both belarger than the observed relative risk. In this paper, we extend the classicalCornfield condition in three directions. First, we consider analogousconditions for the risk difference, and allow for a categorical, not just abinary, unmeasured confounder. Second, we provide more stringent thresholdswhich the maximum of the above-mentioned associations must satisfy, rather thansimply weaker conditions that both must satisfy. Third, we show that allprevious results on Cornfield conditions hold under weaker assumptions thanpreviously used. We illustrate their potential applications by real examples,where our new conditions give more information than the classical ones.\n\n\n\n"

Combining the in situ electronmeasurements and remote-sensing solar observations, as well as the calculatedmagnetic fields obtained from a potential-field source-surface model, wedemonstrate that the jets associated with the hard X-ray flares and type-IIIradio bursts, rather than the slow and partial coronal mass ejections, areclosely related to the production of interplanetary electron streams. The jets,originated from the well-connected active region (AR 10939) whose magneticpolarity structure favors the eruption, are observed to be forming in a coronalsite, extending to a few solar radii, and having a good temporal correlationwith the electron solar release. The open-field lines near the jet site arerooted in a negative polarity, along which energetic particles escape from theflaring AR to the near-Earth space, consistent with the in situ electron pitchangle distribution. The analysis enables us to propose a coronal magnetictopology relating the impulsive SEP events to their solar source.\n\n\n\n"

Most priorwork on windowing assume additional extensions reserved for windowing, whichdoes not comply with standards. Whether windowing should be applied at thetransmitter or the receiver was not questioned. In this work, we propose twoindependent algorithms that are implemented at the transmitter and receiver,respectively. These algorithms estimate the transmitter and receiver windowingduration of each resource element (RE) with an aim to improve fair proportionalnetwork throughput. While doing so, we solely utilize the available extensionthat was defined in the standard and present standard-compliant algorithms thatalso do not require any modifications on the counterparts or control signaling.Furthermore, computationally efficient techniques to apply per-RE transmitterand receiver windowing to signals synthesized and analyzed using conventionalcyclic prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing are derived and theircomputational complexities are analyzed. The spectrotemporal relations betweenoptimum window durations at either side, as well as functions of the excesssignal to noise ratios, the subcarrier spacings and the throughput gainsprovided over previous similar techniques are numerically verified.\n\n\n\n"

Since its introduction in 2001,security researchers have suggested that the protocol is weak, and prone to avariety of attacks against its authentication, link management and encryptionschemes. Key researchers in the field have suggested that reliable passivesniffing of Bluetooth traffic would enable the practical application of a rangeof currently hypothesised attacks. Restricting Bluetooth's frequency hoppingbehaviour by manipulation of the available channels, in order to make bruteforce attacks more effective has been a frequently proposed avenue of futureresearch from the literature. This paper has evaluated the proposed approach ina series of experiments using the software defined radio tools and customhardware developed by the Ubertooth project. The work concludes that themechanism suggested by previous researchers may not deliver the proposedimprovements, but describes an as yet undocumented interaction betweenBluetooth and Wi-Fi technologies which may provide a Denial of Service attackmechanism.\n\n\n\n"

We believe RISC-V should not adopt the memory models of POWER or ARM,because their axiomatic and operational definitions are too complicated. Wepropose two new weak memory models: WMM and WMM-S, which balance definitionalsimplicity and implementation flexibility differently. Both allow allinstruction reorderings except overtaking of loads by a store. We show thatthis restriction has little impact on performance and it considerablysimplifies operational definitions. It also rules out the out-of-thin-airproblem that plagues many definitions. WMM is simple (it is similar to theAlpha memory model), but it disallows behaviors arising due to shared storebuffers and shared write-through caches (which are seen in POWER processors).WMM-S, on the other hand, is more complex and allows these behaviors. We givethe operational definitions of both models using Instantaneous InstructionExecution (I2E), which has been used in the definitions of SC and TSO. We alsoshow how both models can be implemented using conventional cache-coherentmemory systems and out-of-order processors, and encompasses the behaviors ofmost known optimizations.\n\n\n\n"

Semanticsegmentation, which is an important task for element extraction, has beenwidely used in processing mass HRRSIs. However, HRRSIs often exhibit largeintraclass variance and small interclass variance due to the diversity andcomplexity of ground objects, thereby bringing great challenges to a semanticsegmentation task. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end semanticsegmentation network, which integrates lightweight spatial and channelattention modules that can refine features adaptively. We compare our methodwith several classic methods on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets.Experimental results show that our method can achieve better semanticsegmentation results.

The authorsparticipated in three Arabic related subtasks which are: Subtask A (MessagePolarity Classification), Sub-task B (Topic-Based Message Polarityclassification) and Subtask D (Tweet quantification) using the team name ofNileTMRG. For subtask A, we made use of our previously developed sentimentanalyzer which we augmented with a scored lexicon. For subtasks B and D, weused an ensemble of three different classifiers. The first classifier was aconvolutional neural network for which we trained (word2vec) word embeddings.The second classifier consisted of a MultiLayer Perceptron, while the thirdclassifier was a Logistic regression model that takes the same input as thesecond classifier. Voting between the three classifiers was used to determinethe final outcome. The output from task B, was quantified to produce theresults for task D. In all three Arabic related tasks in which NileTMRGparticipated, the team ranked at number one.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Discovery of the hard spectrum VHE gamma-ray source HESS J1641-463\n\nPredicted Title: The Very-highenergy source HESS J1641-463\n\nAbstract:   This letter reports the discovery of a remarkably hard spectrum source, HESSJ1641-463, by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in the very-highenergy (VHE) domain. HESS J1641-463 remained unnoticed by the usual analysistechniques due to confusion with the bright nearby source HESS J1640-465. Itemerged at a significance level of 8.5 standard deviations after restrictingthe analysis to events with energies above 4 TeV. It shows a moderate fluxlevel of F(E > 1 TeV) = (3.64 +/- 0.44_stat +/- 0.73_sys) x 10^-13 cm^-2s-1,corresponding to 1.8% of the Crab Nebula flux above the same energy, and a hardspectrum with a photon index of Gamma = 2.07 +/- 0.11_stat +/- 0.20_sys. It isa point-like source, although an extension up to Gaussian width of sigma = 3arcmin cannot be discounted due to uncertainties in the H.E.S.S. PSF. The VHEgamma-ray flux of HESS J1641-463 is found to be constant over the observedperiod when checking time binnings from year-by-year to the 28 min exposurestimescales. HESS J1641-463 is positionally coincident with the radio supernovaremnant SNR G338.5+0.1. No X-ray candidate stands out as a clear association,however Chandra and XMM-Newton data reveal some potential weak counterparts.Various VHE gamma-ray production scenarios are discussed. If the emission fromHESS J1641-463 is produced by cosmic ray protons colliding with the ambientgas, then their spectrum must extend close to 1 PeV. This object may representa source population contributing significantly to the galactic cosmic ray fluxaround the knee.\n\n\n\n"

      "\nTrue Title: Analysis of the internal heat losses in a thermoelectric generator\n\nPredicted Title: Thermoelectric Model of Bismuth Telluride P-and N-Leg\n\nAbstract:   A 3D thermoelectric numerical model is used to investigate different internalheat loss mechanisms for a thermoelectric generator with bismuth telluride p-and n-legs. The model considers all thermoelectric effects, temperaturedependent material parameters and simultaneous convective, conductive andradiative heat losses, including surface to surface radiation. For radiativeheat losses it is shown that for the temperatures considered here, surface toambient radiation is a good approximation of the heat loss. For conductive heattransfer the module efficiency is shown to be comparable to the case ofradiative losses. Finally, heat losses due to internal natural convection inthe module is shown to be negligible for the millimetre sized modulesconsidered here. The combined case of radiative and conductive heat transferresulted in the lowest efficiency. The optimized load resistance is found todecrease for increased heat loss. The leg dimensions are varied for all heatlosses cases and it is shown that the ideal way to construct a TEG module withminimal heat losses and maximum efficiency is to either use a good insulatingmaterial between the legs or evacuate the module completely, and use small andwide legs closely spaced.\n\n\n\n"

In this paper, which should be viewed as a precursor of theforthcoming volume by the authors and Alan Roche, we leverage modern technology(for example, the Moy-Prasad theory) to compute explicit character tables. Aninteresting highlight is the computation of the 'exceptional' supercuspidalcharacters, i.e., those depth-zero representations not arising byinflation-induction from a Deligne-Lusztig representation of finite$\\operatorname{SL}_2$; this provides a concrete application for the recent workof DeBacker and Kazhdan.\n\n\n\n"

It is a disease whereearly detection is of crucial importance. Colonoscopy is commonly used forearly detection of cancer and precancerous pathology. It is a demandingprocedure requiring significant amount of time from specialized physicians andnurses, in addition to a significant miss-rates of polyps by specialists.Automated polyp detection in colonoscopy videos has been demonstrated to be apromising way to handle this problem. {However, polyps detection is achallenging problem due to the availability of limited amount of training dataand large appearance variations of polyps. To handle this problem, we propose anovel deep learning method Y-Net that consists of two encoder networks with adecoder network. Our proposed Y-Net method} relies on efficient use ofpre-trained and un-trained models with novel sum-skip-concatenation operations.Each of the encoders are trained with encoder specific learning rate along thedecoder. Compared with the previous methods employing hand-crafted features or2-D/3-D convolutional neural network, our approach outperforms state-of-the-artmethods for polyp detection with 7.3% F1-score and 13% recall improvement.\n\n\n\n"

Nine Ramanactive modes of $A_g$ and $B_g$ symmetry are clearly observed and assigned byprobing different scattering channels, which is confirmed by lattice dynamicscalculations. Temperature dependence of the Raman modes linewidth is mainlygoverned by the lattice anharmonicity. The only deviation from the conventionalbehavior is observed for $A_g$ symmetry modes in a vicinity of the magneticphase transition at $T_N \\approx 200$ K. This implies that the electron-phononinteraction weakly changes with temperature and magnetic ordering, whereassmall changes in the spectra near the critical temperature can be ascribed tospin fluctuations.\n\n\n\n"

Correlated components are identified under theassumption that the involved spatial networks are identical. Here we propose ahierarchical probabilistic model that can infer the level of universality insuch multi-view data, from completely unrelated representations, correspondingto canonical correlation analysis, to identical representations as incorrelated component analysis. This new model, which we denote Bayesiancorrelated component analysis, evaluates favourably against three relevantalgorithms in simulated data. A well-established benchmark EEG dataset is usedto further validate the new model and infer the variability of spatialrepresentations across multiple subjects.\n\n\n\n"

Arveson (2007),Kaftal, Ng, Zhang (2009), and Argerami (2015) all provide different proofs ofthat integrality condition. In this paper we interpret the integralitycondition in terms of the essential codimension of a pair of projectionsintroduced by Brown, Douglas and Fillmore (1973), or, equivalently of the indexof a Fredholm pair of projections introduced by Avron, Seiler, and Simon(1994). The same techniques explain the integer occurring in thecharacterization of diagonals of selfadjoint operators with finite spectrum byBownik and Jasper (2015).\n\n\n\n"
