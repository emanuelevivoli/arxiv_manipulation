    "#### In this notebook, we use [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) Transformer model to perform title generation from abstracts. BART is a sequence-to-sequence model where both the input and targets are text sequences. BART is commonly used for text summarization. In our case, we would want to summarize titles from abstracts."

While the former is state-based andgeneralizes the notion of states and finite state machines to allow formulti-action planning, the latter is behavior-based and exploits a hierarchicalstructure and the concept of inhibitions to allow for dynamic transitioning.The two frameworks have completely independent implementations, but can be usedeffectively in tandem to solve behavior control problems on all levels ofgranularity. Both frameworks have been used to control the NimbRo-OP, ahumanoid soccer robot developed by team NimbRo of the University of Bonn.\n",

We examine the problem in the interaction picture(Tomonaga-Schwinger equation), the Heisenberg picture(Yang-Feldman-K\\\"all\\'{e}n equation) and the path integral approach. They allindicate inconsistency when time is taken as a noncommutative coordinate. Thecausality issue appears as the key aspect, while the unitarity problem issubsidiary. These results are consistent with string theory, which does notadmit a time-space noncommutative quantum field theory as its low-energy limit,with the exception of light-like noncommutativity.\n",

      "Abstract:   The nonlinear thin-shell instability (NTSI) may explain some of the turbulenthydrodynamic structures that are observed close to the collision boundary ofenergetic astrophysical outflows. It develops in nonplanar shells that arebounded on either side by a hydrodynamic shock, provided that the amplitude ofthe seed oscillations is sufficiently large. The hydrodynamic NTSI has amicroscopic counterpart in collisionless plasma. A sinusoidal displacement of athin shell, which is formed by the collision of two clouds of unmagnetizedelectrons and protons, grows and saturates on timescales of the order of theinverse proton plasma frequency. Here we increase the wavelength of the seedperturbation by a factor 4 compared to that in a previous study. Like in thecase of the hydrodynamic NTSI, the increase in the wavelength reduces thegrowth rate of the microscopic NTSI. The prolonged growth time of themicroscopic NTSI allows the waves, which are driven by the competing ionacoustic instability, to grow to a large amplitude before the NTSI saturatesand they disrupt the latter. The ion acoustic instability thus imposes a limiton the largest wavelength that can be destabilized by the NTSI in collisionlessplasma. The limit can be overcome by binary collisions. We bring forwardevidence for an overstability of the collisionless NTSI.\n",

      "Abstract:   Prosthetic hands can help people with limb difference to return to their liferoutines. Commercial prostheses, however have several limitations in providingan acceptable dexterity. We approach these limitations by augmenting theprosthetic hands with an off-the-shelf depth sensor to enable the prosthesis tosee the object's depth, record a single view (2.5-D) snapshot, and estimate anappropriate grasp type; using a deep network architecture based on 3D pointclouds called PointNet. The human can act as the supervisor throughout theprocedure by accepting or refusing the suggested grasp type. We achieved thegrasp classification accuracy of up to 88%. Contrary to the case of the RGBdata, the depth data provides all the necessary object shape information, whichis required for grasp recognition. The PointNet not only enables using 3-D datain practice, but it also prevents excessive computations. Augmentation of theprosthetic hands with such a semi-autonomous system can lead to betterdifferentiation of grasp types, less burden on user, and better performance.\n",

      "Abstract:   Many studies of neural activity in behaving animals aim to discoverinterpretable low-dimensional structure in large-scale neural populationrecordings. One approach to this problem is demixed principal componentanalysis (dPCA), a supervised linear dimensionality reduction technique to findcomponents that depend on particular experimental parameters. Here, I introducekernel dPCA (kdPCA) as a nonlinear extension of dPCA by applying kernelleast-squares regression to the demixing problem. I consider simulated examplesof neural populations with low-dimensional activity to compare the componentsrecovered from dPCA and kdPCA. These simulations demonstrate that neurallyrelevant nonlinearities, such as stimulus-dependent gain and rotation,interfere with linear demixing of neural activity into components thatrepresent to individual experimental parameters. However, kdPCA can stillrecover interpretable components in these examples. Finally, I demonstratekdPCA using two examples of neural populations recorded during perceptualdecision-making tasks.\n",

      "Abstract:   Actively shought since the turn of the century, two-dimensional quantum spinliquids (QSLs) are exotic phases of matter where magnetic moments remaindisordered even at extremely low temperatures. Despite ongoing searches, QSLsremain elusive, due to a lack of concrete knowledge of the microscopicmechanisms that inhibit magnetic order in real materials. Here, we study atheoretical model for a broad class of frustrated magnetic rare-earthpyrochlore materials called \"quantum spin ices\". When subject to an externalmagnetic field along the [111] crystallographic direction, the resulting spininteractions contain a mix of geometric frustration and quantum fluctuations indecoupled two-dimensional kagome planes. Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlosimulations, we identify a simple set of interactions sufficient to promote agroundstate with no magnetic long-range order, and a gap to excitations,consistent with a $Z_2$ spin liquid phase. This suggests a systematicexperimental procedure to search for two-dimensional QSLs within the broaderclass of three-dimensional pyrochlore quantum spin ice materials.\n",

Thevacuum transition rate is evaluated numerically by searching for the bounceconfiguration. Like stability, a metastability bound does not decouple even ifsfermion masses grow. Apart from being more generous than stability, the newbounds are largely independent of Yukawa couplings except for the stoptrilinears. With vacuum longevity imposed on otherwise arbitrary LR insertions,it is found that a super flavour factory has the potential to probe sparticlemasses up to a few TeV through B and tau physics whereas the MEG experimentmight cover a far wider range. In the stop sector, metastability is morerestrictive than any existing experimental constraint such as from electroweakprecision data.

The second magnetization peak (SMP) hasbeen observed at temperatures below $T_c$/2 and vanished at highertemperatures. The observed behaviour of the SMP has been studied by measuringthe magnetic field dependence of relaxation rate, $R(H)$ and by performing theMaley's analysis.

Thisstudy demonstrates that this approach has the potential to be one of the bestspace-time trade-off methods, representing a joining link between punctual andsatellite fields of view. The inverse proportionality between soil moisture andgamma signal is theoretically derived taking into account a non-constantcorrection due to the presence of growing vegetation beneath the detectorposition. The gamma signal attenuation due to biomass is modelled with a MonteCarlo-based approach in terms of an equivalent water layer which thicknessvaries in time as the crop evolves during its life-cycle. The reliability andeffectiveness of this approach is proved through a 7 months continuousacquisition of terrestrial gamma radiation in a 0.4 ha tomato (Solanumlycopersicum) test field. We demonstrate that a permanent gamma stationinstalled at an agricultural field can reliably probe the water content of thetop soil only if systematic effects due to the biomass shielding are properlyaccounted for. Biomass corrected experimental values of soil water contentinferred from radiometric measurements are compared with gravimetric dataacquired under different soil moisture levels, resulting in an averagepercentage relative discrepancy of about 3% in bare soil condition and of 4%during the vegetated period. The temporal evolution of corrected soil watercontent values exhibits a dynamic range coherent with the soil hydraulicproperties in terms of wilting point, field capacity and saturation.\n",

      "Abstract:   We present the first perception-aware model predictive control framework forquadrotors that unifies control and planning with respect to action andperception objectives. Our framework leverages numerical optimization tocompute trajectories that satisfy the system dynamics and require controlinputs within the limits of the platform. Simultaneously, it optimizesperception objectives for robust and reliable sens- ing by maximizing thevisibility of a point of interest and minimizing its velocity in the imageplane. Considering both perception and action objectives for motion planningand control is challenging due to the possible conflicts arising from theirrespective requirements. For example, for a quadrotor to track a referencetrajectory, it needs to rotate to align its thrust with the direction of thedesired acceleration. However, the perception objective might require tominimize such rotation to maximize the visibility of a point of interest. Amodel-based optimization framework, able to consider both perception and actionobjectives and couple them through the system dynamics, is therefore necessary.Our perception-aware model predictive control framework works in areceding-horizon fashion by iteratively solving a non-linear optimizationproblem. It is capable of running in real-time, fully onboard our lightweight,small-scale quadrotor using a low-power ARM computer, to- gether with avisual-inertial odometry pipeline.

      "Abstract:   The support vector machine (SVM) is a popular machine learning classificationmethod which produces a nonlinear decision boundary in a feature space byconstructing linear boundaries in a transformed Hilbert space. It is well knownthat these algorithms when executed on a classical computer do not scale wellwith the size of the feature space both in terms of data points anddimensionality. One of the most significant limitations of classical algorithmsusing non-linear kernels is that the kernel function has to be evaluated forall pairs of input feature vectors which themselves may be of substantiallyhigh dimension. This can lead to computationally excessive times duringtraining and during the prediction process for a new data point. Here, wepropose using both canonical and generalized coherent states to rapidlycalculate specific nonlinear kernel functions. The key link will be thereproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) property for SVMs that naturally arisefrom canonical and generalized coherent states. Specifically, we discuss thefast evaluation of radial kernels through a positive operator valued measure(POVM) on a quantum optical system based on canonical coherent states. Asimilar procedure may also lead to fast calculations of kernels not usuallyused in classical algorithms such as those arising from generalized coherentstates.\n",

We prove that a sequence$W_1,W_2,W_3,\\ldots$ of graphons converges in the cut distance if and only ifwe have equality of the sets of weak* accumulation points and of weak* limitpoints of all sequences of graphons $W_1',W_2',W_3',\\ldots$ that are weaklyisomorphic to $W_1,W_2,W_3,\\ldots$. We further give a short descriptive settheoretic argument that each sequence of graphons contains a subsequence withthe property above. This in particular provides an alternative proof of thetheorem of Lov\\'asz and Szegedy about compactness of the space of graphons. Weconnect these results to \"multiway cut\" characterization of cut distanceconvergence from [Ann. of Math. (2) 176 (2012), no. 1, 151-219].  These results are more naturally phrased in the Vietoris hyperspace $K$ overgraphons with the weak* topology. We show that graphons with the cut distancetopology are homeomorphic to a closed subset of $K$, and deduce severalconsequences of this fact.  From these concepts a new order on the space of graphons emerges. This orderallows to compare how structured two graphons are. We establish basicproperties of this \"structurdness order\".\n",

The main ISBSG dataset was filtered and thendivided into five datasets based on the productivity value of each project.Results show that the four models tend to overestimate in 80percent of thedatasets, and the significance of the model inputs varies based on the selectedmodel. Furthermore, the Cascade Correlation Neural Network outperforms theother three models in the majority of the datasets constructed on the MeanAbsolute Residual criterion.\n",

      "Abstract:   Evolutionary trajectories and phenotypic states available to cell populationsare ultimately dictated by intermolecular interactions between DNA, RNA,proteins, and other molecular species. Here we study how evolution of generegulation in a single-cell eukaryote S. cerevisiae is affected by theinteractions between transcription factors (TFs) and their cognate genomicsites. Our study is informed by high-throughput in vitro measurements of TF-DNAbinding interactions and by a comprehensive collection of genomic bindingsites. Using an evolutionary model for monomorphic populations evolving on afitness landscape, we infer fitness as a function of TF-DNA binding energy fora collection of 12 yeast TFs, and show that the shape of the predicted fitnessfunctions is in broad agreement with a simple thermodynamic model of two-stateTF-DNA binding. However, the effective temperature of the model is not alwaysequal to the physical temperature, indicating selection pressures in additionto biophysical constraints caused by TF-DNA interactions. We find littlestatistical support for the fitness landscape in which each position in thebinding site evolves independently, showing that epistasis is common inevolution of gene regulation. Finally, by correlating TF-DNA binding energieswith biological properties of the sites or the genes they regulate, we are ableto rule out several scenarios of site-specific selection, under which bindingsites of the same TF would experience a spectrum of selection pressuresdepending on their position in the genome. These findings argue for theexistence of universal fitness landscapes which shape evolution of all sitesfor a given TF, and whose properties are determined in part by the physics ofprotein-DNA interactions.\n",

Semanticsegmentation, which is an important task for element extraction, has beenwidely used in processing mass HRRSIs. However, HRRSIs often exhibit largeintraclass variance and small interclass variance due to the diversity andcomplexity of ground objects, thereby bringing great challenges to a semanticsegmentation task. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end semanticsegmentation network, which integrates lightweight spatial and channelattention modules that can refine features adaptively. We compare our methodwith several classic methods on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets.Experimental results show that our method can achieve better semanticsegmentation results.

One approach to this problem is demixed principal componentanalysis (dPCA), a supervised linear dimensionality reduction technique to findcomponents that depend on particular experimental parameters. Here, I introducekernel dPCA (kdPCA) as a nonlinear extension of dPCA by applying kernelleast-squares regression to the demixing problem. I consider simulated examplesof neural populations with low-dimensional activity to compare the componentsrecovered from dPCA and kdPCA. These simulations demonstrate that neurallyrelevant nonlinearities, such as stimulus-dependent gain and rotation,interfere with linear demixing of neural activity into components thatrepresent to individual experimental parameters. However, kdPCA can stillrecover interpretable components in these examples. Finally, I demonstratekdPCA using two examples of neural populations recorded during perceptualdecision-making tasks.\n",

      "Abstract:   The memory model for RISC-V, a newly developed open source ISA, has not beenfinalized yet and thus, offers an opportunity to evaluate existing memorymodels. We believe RISC-V should not adopt the memory models of POWER or ARM,because their axiomatic and operational definitions are too complicated. Wepropose two new weak memory models: WMM and WMM-S, which balance definitionalsimplicity and implementation flexibility differently. Both allow allinstruction reorderings except overtaking of loads by a store. We show thatthis restriction has little impact on performance and it considerablysimplifies operational definitions. It also rules out the out-of-thin-airproblem that plagues many definitions. WMM is simple (it is similar to theAlpha memory model), but it disallows behaviors arising due to shared storebuffers and shared write-through caches (which are seen in POWER processors).WMM-S, on the other hand, is more complex and allows these behaviors. We givethe operational definitions of both models using Instantaneous InstructionExecution (I2E), which has been used in the definitions of SC and TSO. We alsoshow how both models can be implemented using conventional cache-coherentmemory systems and out-of-order processors, and encompasses the behaviors ofmost known optimizations.\n",

We also studied the water contact angle in function of plasma processtime of PDMS surfaces with each kind of plasma treatment. The plasma wascharacterized by optical emission spectroscopy (OES) to identify the emittingspecies and determine the plasma temperatures. The plasma temperature for eachprocess was estimated comparing the spectrum obtained by OES with the spectrumgenerated by SpecAir simulation code. Measurements of power delivered to theplasmas were also performed. As the results, all the process using differentgases show good adhesion efficacy between PDMS samples when long exposure time(larger than 150 seconds) is applied. However, when only a few discharges areapplied to PDMS samples the helium plasma process presented best results.Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analysis of PDMS samples treated with heliumplasma showed reduction in the surface roughness, which increase the surfacecontact area and improves the adhesion.\n",

As dust samples we use mixtures ofiron and quartz in different ratios. Without magnetic fields, particles in allsamples grow into a bouncing barrier. These aggregates reversibly form largerclusters in the presence of magnetic fields. The size of these clusters dependson the strength of the magnetic field and the ratio between iron and quartz.The clustering increases the size of the largest entities by a factor of a few.If planetesimal formation is sensitive to the size of the largest aggregates,e.g., relying on streaming instabilities, then planetesimals willpreferentially grow iron-rich in the inner region of protoplanetary disks.

There is need for individuals and organizations such as hospitals tobe able to locate required drugs within given geographical vicinity. This is ofimmense importance especially during emergencies, travel, and in cases wherethe drugs are uncommon. This research work is aimed at solving this problem bydesigning a system that integrates all drugstores. The integration of the drugstores will be based on SOA concepts with web services via a central servicebus. The database systems of the drug stores will be integrated via a servicebus such that drugs can easily be searched for and the results will bedisplayed based on its availability. Drugs can easily be searched for withingeographically distributed pharmaceutical databases as well as consumption ofdrugs with relation to geographical locations can easily be monitored andtracked.

We use a well-defined sample of 500nearby (< 100 Mpc) SNe and their low-inclined (i < 60 deg) and morphologicallynon-disturbed S0-Sm host galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We findthat in Sa-Sm galaxies, all core-collapse (CC) and vast majority of SNe Iabelong to the disc, rather than the bulge component. The radial distribution ofSNe Ia in S0-S0/a galaxies is inconsistent with their distribution in Sa-Smhosts, which is probably due to the contribution of the outer bulge SNe Ia inS0-S0/a galaxies. In Sa-Sbc galaxies, the radial distribution of CC SNe inbarred hosts is inconsistent with that in unbarred ones, while thedistributions of SNe Ia are not significantly different. At the same time, theradial distributions of both types of SNe in Sc-Sm galaxies are not affected bybars. We propose that the additional mechanism shaping the distributions ofType Ia and CC SNe can be explained within the framework of substantialsuppression of massive star formation in the radial range swept by strong bars,particularly in early-type spirals. The radial distribution of CC SNe inunbarred Sa-Sbc galaxies is more centrally peaked and inconsistent with that inunbarred Sc-Sm hosts, while the distribution of SNe Ia in unbarred galaxies isnot affected by host morphology.

      "Abstract:   This article is an overview of the \"SP theory of intelligence\". The theoryaims to simplify and integrate concepts across artificial intelligence,mainstream computing and human perception and cognition, with informationcompression as a unifying theme. It is conceived as a brain-like system thatreceives 'New' information and stores some or all of it in compressed form as'Old' information. It is realised in the form of a computer model -- a firstversion of the SP machine. The concept of \"multiple alignment\" is a powerfulcentral idea. Using heuristic techniques, the system builds multiple alignmentsthat are 'good' in terms of information compression. For each multiplealignment, probabilities may be calculated. These provide the basis forcalculating the probabilities of inferences. The system learns new structuresfrom partial matches between patterns. Using heuristic techniques, the systemsearches for sets of structures that are 'good' in terms of informationcompression. These are normally ones that people judge to be 'natural', inaccordance with the 'DONSVIC' principle -- the discovery of natural structuresvia information compression. The SP theory may be applied in several areasincluding 'computing', aspects of mathematics and logic, representation ofknowledge, natural language processing, pattern recognition, several kinds ofreasoning, information storage and retrieval, planning and problem solving,information compression, neuroscience, and human perception and cognition.Examples include the parsing and production of language including discontinuousdependencies in syntax, pattern recognition at multiple levels of abstractionand its integration with part-whole relations, nonmonotonic reasoning andreasoning with default values, reasoning in Bayesian networks including'explaining away', causal diagnosis, and the solving of a geometric analogyproblem.\n",

We prove that a sequence$W_1,W_2,W_3,\\ldots$ of graphons converges in the cut distance if and only ifwe have equality of the sets of weak* accumulation points and of weak* limitpoints of all sequences of graphons $W_1',W_2',W_3',\\ldots$ that are weaklyisomorphic to $W_1,W_2,W_3,\\ldots$. We further give a short descriptive settheoretic argument that each sequence of graphons contains a subsequence withthe property above. This in particular provides an alternative proof of thetheorem of Lov\\'asz and Szegedy about compactness of the space of graphons. Weconnect these results to \"multiway cut\" characterization of cut distanceconvergence from [Ann. of Math. (2) 176 (2012), no. 1, 151-219].  These results are more naturally phrased in the Vietoris hyperspace $K$ overgraphons with the weak* topology. We show that graphons with the cut distancetopology are homeomorphic to a closed subset of $K$, and deduce severalconsequences of this fact.  From these concepts a new order on the space of graphons emerges. This orderallows to compare how structured two graphons are. We establish basicproperties of this \"structurdness order\".\n",

      "\n",
      "Abstract:   The spread of synthetic gene drives is often discussed in the context ofpanmictic populations connected by gene flow and described with simpledeterministic models. Under such assumptions, an entire species could bealtered by releasing a single individual carrying an invasive gene drive, suchas a standard homing drive. While this remains a theoretical possibility, genedrive spread in natural populations is more complex and merits a more realisticassessment. The fate of any gene drive released in a population would beinextricably linked to the ecology of the population. Given the uncertaintyoften involved in ecological assessment of natural populations, understandingthe sensitivity of gene drive spread to important ecological factors iscritical. Here we review how different forms of density-dependence, spatialheterogeneity and mating behaviors can impact the spread of self-sustaininggene drives. We highlight specific aspects of gene drive dynamics and thetarget populations that need further research.\n",

We elaborate on thegauge prepotentials and linearised super-Cotton tensors for higher spin N=1superconformal geometry and propose compensating superfields required toformulate off-shell massless higher spin supermultiplets. The correspondinggauge-invariant actions are worked out explicitly using an auxiliary oscillatorrealisation. We construct, for the first time, off-shell massive higher spinsupermultiplets. The gauge-invariant actions for these supermultiplets areobtained by adding Chern-Simons like mass terms (that is, higher spinextensions of the linearised action for N=1 conformal supergravity) to theactions for the massless supermultiplets. For each of the massive gravitino andsupergravity multiplets, we propose two dually equivalent formulations.\n",

      "Abstract:   Swarm robotics has experienced a rapid expansion in recent years, primarilyfueled by specialized multi-robot systems developed to achieve dedicatedcollective actions. These specialized platforms are in general designed withswarming considerations at the front and center. Key hardware and softwareelements required for swarming are often deeply embedded and integrated withthe particular system. However, given the noticeable increase in the number oflow-cost mobile robots readily available, practitioners and hobbyists may startconsidering to assemble full-fledged swarms by minimally retrofitting suchmobile platforms with a swarm-enabling technology. Here, we report one possibleembodiment of such a technology designed to enable the assembly and the studyof swarming in a range of general-purpose robotic systems. This is achieved bycombining a modular and transferable software toolbox with a hardware suitecomposed of a collection of low-cost and off-the-shelf components. Thedeveloped technology can be ported to a relatively vast range of roboticplatforms with minimal changes and high levels of scalability. Thisswarm-enabling technology has successfully been implemented on two distinctdistributed multi-robot systems, a swarm of mobile marine buoys and a team ofcommercial terrestrial robots. We have tested the effectiveness of both ofthese distributed robotic systems in performing collective exploration andsearch scenarios, as well as other classical cooperative behaviors.Experimental results on different swarm behaviors are reported for the twoplatforms in uncontrolled environments and without any supportinginfrastructure. The design of the associated software library allows for aseamless switch to other cooperative behaviors, and also offers the possibilityto simulate newly designed collective behaviors prior to their implementationonto the platforms.\n",

      "Abstract:   Thermal photon emission is widely believed to reflect properties of theearliest, hottest evolution stage of the medium created in ultra-relativisticheavy-ion collisions. Previous computations of photon emission have beencarried out using a hydrodynamical medium description with smooth, averagedinitial conditions. Recently, more sophisticated hydrodynamical models whichcalculate observables by averaging over many evolutions with event-by-eventfluctuating initial conditions (IC) have been developed. Given their directconnection to the early time dynamics, thermal photon emission appears an idealobservable to probe fluctuations in the medium initial state. In this work, wedemonstrate that including fluctuations in the IC may lead to an enhancement ofthe thermal photon yield of about a factor of 2 in the region $2 < p_T < 4$GeV/$c$ (where thermal photon production dominates the direct photon yield)compared to a scenario using smooth, averaged IC. Consequently, a much betteragreement with PHENIX data is found. This can be understood in terms of thestrong temperature dependence of thermal photon production, translating into asensitivity to the presence of 'hotspots' in an event and thus establishingthermal photons as a suitable probe to characterize IC fluctuations.\n",

In the case of semidilute unentangled solutions, defining theWeissenberg number in terms of a concentration dependent large scale relaxationtime is found not to lead to data collapse across different concentrations.

Theoretically, we compute the geometric phases acquired by aninitial pseudo-NSCS on undergoing three distinct cyclic evolutions: $ i) $ thefree evolution of the NMR quadrupolar system and, by analogy with the evolutionof the NMR quadrupolar system, that of $ii)$ single-mode and $ iii)$ two-modeBose-Einstein Condensate like system.

Intuitively one expects that the convolutional networkperforms poorly in these circumstances in contrast to a multilayer perceptron(MLPs) whose classification accuracy should not be affected by the pixelrandomization. This work shows that by randomizing image pixels thehierarchical structure of the data is destroyed and long range correlations areintroduced which standard CNNs are not able to capture.

      "Abstract:   In this paper, a new precoder for a coherent optical filter bank multicarrierwith offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC/OQAM) system is proposed. Theprecoder is designed based on an iterative polynomial eigenvalue decomposition(PEVD) algorithm to jointly mitigate the inter-symbol interference (ISI) andinter-carrier interference (ICI). The PEVD algorithm is used to decompose apolynomial channel matrix into polynomial eigenvectors and eigenvaluesmatrices, then a precoder is designed based on the decomposed matrices. Theprecoder acts as a filter applied to each subcarrier and to its adjacentsubcarriers. In addition, a new adaptive optimum energy algorithm is proposedto truncate the insignificant precoder filter coefficients produced by the PEVDalgorithm and consequently reduce the computational complexity. A mathematicalmodel and algorithm for implementing the precoder are also presented.Robustness of the proposed precoder has been analyzed and compared to existingprecoder in optical channel with different dispersion effects. Numericalresults demonstrate that the new precoder significantly outperforms theexisting precoder in terms of error vector magnitude (EVM), bit error rate(BER), Frobenius norm of the error matrix, and computational complexity.\n",

Rice production is acomplex process and non linear problem involving soil, crop, weather, pest,disease, capital, labour and management parameters. ANN software was designedand developed with Feed Forward Back Propagation (FFBP) network to predict riceproduction. The input layer has six independent variables like area ofcultivation and rice production in three seasons like Kuruvai, Samba and Kodai.The popular sigmoid activation function was adopted to convert input data intosigmoid values. The hidden layer computes the summation of six sigmoid valueswith six sets of weightages. The final output was converted into sigmoid valuesusing a sigmoid transfer function. ANN outputs are the predicted results. Theerror between original data and ANN output values were computed. A thresholdvalue of 10-9 was used to test whether the error is greater than the thresholdlevel. If the error is greater than threshold then updating of weights was doneall summations were done by back propagation. This process was repeated untilerror equal to zero. The predicted results were printed and it was found to beexactly matching with the expected values. It shows that the ANN prediction was100% accurate.\n",

      "Abstract:   Constraint satisfaction problems have been studied in numerous fields withpractical and theoretical interests. In recent years, major breakthroughs havebeen made in a study of counting constraint satisfaction problems (or #CSPs).In particular, a computational complexity classification of bounded-degree#CSPs has been discovered for all degrees except for two, where the \"degree\" ofan input instance is the maximal number of times that each input variableappears in a given set of constraints. Despite the efforts of recent studies,however, a complexity classification of degree-2 #CSPs has eluded from ourunderstandings. This paper challenges this open problem and gives its partialsolution by applying two novel proof techniques--T_{2}-constructibility andparametrized symmetrization--which are specifically designed to handle\"arbitrary\" constraints under randomized approximation-preserving reductions.We partition entire constraints into four sets and we classify theapproximation complexity of all degree-2 #CSPs whose constraints are drawn fromtwo of the four sets into two categories: problems computable inpolynomial-time or problems that are at least as hard as #SAT. Our proofexploits a close relationship between complex-weighted degree-2 #CSPs andHolant problems, which are a natural generalization of complex-weighted #CSPs.\n",

      "Abstract:   The empty space (with no matter fields) is not really empty because ofnatural metric fluctuations, quantum and classical. We show that gravitons aswell as classical gravitational waves of super-horizon wavelengths are able toform the de Sitter state of the empty homogeneous isotropic Universe. Thisstate is the exact solution to the self-consistent equations of one-loopquantum gravity for gravitons in the empty FLRW space. It also is the exactsolution to the self-consistent equations of back reaction for classicalgravitational waves. Technically, to get this de Sitter solution in bothquantum and classical cases, it is necessary to make the transition toimaginary time and then come back to real time which is possible because thisde Sitter state is invariant with respect to Wick rotation. Such a proceduremeans that the time was used as a complex variable, and this fact has a deepbut still not understood meaning. De Sitter accelerated expansion of the emptyUniverse naturally explains the origin of dark energy and inflation because theUniverse is empty at the start and by the end of its evolution. This theory isconsistent with the existing observational data. The CMB anisotropy of theorder of 10^-5 is produced by fluctuations in the number of gravitons. Theexistence of a threshold and unique coincidence of topologically impenetrablebarriers for tunneling takes place for the matter-dominated epoch and De SitterState only. These facts provide a solution to the coincidence problem. Thetheoretical prediction that the equation-of-state parameter should be w>-1 forinflation and w<-1 for dark energy is consistent with observational data.

Interfaces, if well designed, significantly reducesoftware complexity and ease maintainability . However, as software evolves,the organization and the quality of software interfaces gradually deteriorate.As a consequence, this often leads to increased development cost, lower codequality and reduced reusability . Code clones are one of the most known badsmells in source code. This design defect may occur in interfaces byduplicating method/API declarations in several interfaces. Such interfaces aresimilar from the point of view of public services/APIs they specify, thus theyindicate a bad organization of application services. In this paper, wecharacterize the interface clone design defect and illustrate it via examplestaken from real-world open source software applications. We conduct anempirical study covering nine real-world open source software applications toquantify the presence of interface clones and evaluate their impact oninterface design quality . The results of the empirical study show thatinterface clones are widely present in software interfaces. They also show thatthe presence of interface clones may cause a degradation of interface cohesionand indicate a considerable presence of code clones at implementations level.\n",

      "Abstract:   The Eckart co-rotating frame is used to analyze the dynamics of star polymersunder shear flow, either in melt or solution and with different types of bonds.This formalism is compared with the standard approach used in many previousstudies on polymer dynamics, where an apparent angular velocity $\\omega$ isobtained from relation between the tensor of inertia and angular momentum. Acommon mistake is to interpret $\\omega$ as the molecular rotation frequency,which is only valid for rigid-body rotation. The Eckart frame, originallyformulated to analyze the infrared spectra of small molecules, dissectsdifferent kinds of displacements: vibrations without angular momentum, purerotation, and vibrational angular momentum (leading to a Coriolis cross-term).The Eckart frame co-rotates with the molecule with an angular frequency$\\Omega$ obtained from the Eckart condition for minimal coupling betweenrotation and vibration. The standard and Eckart approaches are compared with astraight description of the star's dynamics taken from the time autocorrelationof the monomers positions moving around the molecule's center of mass. This isan underdamped oscillatory signal, which can be described by a rotationfrequency $\\omega_R$ and a decorrelation rate $\\Gamma$. We consistently findthat $\\Omega$ coincides with $\\omega_R$, which determines the characteristictank-treading rotation of the star. By contrast, the apparent angular velocity$\\omega < \\Omega$ does not discern between pure rotation and molecularvibrations. We believe that the Eckart frame will be useful to unveil thedynamics of semiflexible molecules where rotation and deformations areentangled, including tumbling, tank-treading motions and breathing modes.\n",

A legacycentral controller can be eliminated in order to avoid a single point offailure, relieve computational burden, maintain data privacy, and supportplug-and-play functionalities. The optimal economic dispatch is achieved byallowing the iterative coordination of local agents (consumers and distributedgenerators). As coordination information, the local estimation of powermismatch is shared among distributed generators through communication networksand does not contain any private information, ultimately contributing to a fairelectricity market. Additionally, the proposed distributed algorithm isparticularly designed for easy implementation and configuration of a largenumber of agents in which the distributed decision making can be implemented ina simple proportional-integral (PI) or integral (I) controller. InMATLAB/Simulink simulation, the accuracy of the proposed distributed algorithmis demonstrated in a 29-node system in comparison with the centralizedalgorithm. Scalability and a fast convergence rate are also demonstrated in a1400-node case study.

The theoretical uncertainties of stellar interiors accumulate withstellar age, which is particularly pertinent for the blue supergiant phase.Stellar oscillations represent a unique method of probing stellar interiors,yet inference for blue supergiants is hampered by a dearth of observedpulsation modes. Here we report the detection of diverse variability in bluesupergiants using the K2 and TESS space missions. The discovery of pulsationmodes or an entire spectrum of low-frequency gravity waves in these stars allowus to map the evolution of hot massive stars towards the ends of their lives.Future asteroseismic modelling will provide constraints on ages, core masses,interior mixing, rotation and angular momentum transport.

      "Abstract:   Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful tool to perform data-driven optimalcontrol without relying on a model of the system. However, RL struggles toprovide hard guarantees on the behavior of the resulting control scheme. Incontrast, Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and Economic NMPC (ENMPC)are standard tools for the closed-loop optimal control of complex systems withconstraints and limitations, and benefit from a rich theory to assess theirclosed-loop behavior. Unfortunately, the performance of (E)NMPC hinges on thequality of the model underlying the control scheme. In this paper, we show thatan (E)NMPC scheme can be tuned to deliver the optimal policy of the real systemeven when using a wrong model. This result also holds for real systems havingstochastic dynamics. This entails that ENMPC can be used as a new type offunction approximator within RL. Furthermore, we investigate our results in thecontext of ENMPC and formally connect them to the concept of dissipativity,which is central for the ENMPC stability. Finally, we detail how these resultscan be used to deploy classic RL tools for tuning (E)NMPC schemes. We applythese tools on both a classical linear MPC setting and a standard nonlinearexample from the ENMPC literature.\n",

We derive the energy-momenta relation ofomega-infinity single spikes as their linear velocity v-->1 and their angularmomentum J-->1. Generally, the v-->1, J-->1 limit of single spikes is singularand has to be excluded from the spectrum and be studied separately. We discoverthat the dispersion relation of omega-infinity single spikes containslogarithms in the limit J-->1. This result is somewhat surprising, since thelogarithmic behavior in the string spectra is typically associated with theirmotion in non-compact spaces such as AdS. Omega-infinity single spikes seem tocompletely cover the surface of the 2-sphere they occupy, so that they mayessentially be viewed as some sort of \"brany strings\". A proof of thesphere-filling property of omega-infinity single spikes is given in theappendix.\n",

      "\n",
      "Abstract:   The metallicity of a star strongly affects both its evolution and theproperties of the stellar remnant that results from its demise. It is generallyaccepted that stars with initial masses below ~8 M_sun leave behind whitedwarfs and that some sub-population of these lead to Type Ia supernovae.However, it is often tacitly assumed that metallicity has no effect on the rateof SNe Ia. We propose that a consequence of the effects of metallicity is tosignificantly increase the SN Ia rate in lower-metallicity galaxies, incontrast to previous expectations. This is because lower-metallicity starsleave behind higher-mass white dwarfs, which should be easier to bring toexplosion. We first model SN Ia rates in relation to galaxy masses and agesalone, finding that the elevation in the rate of SNe Ia in lower-mass galaxiesmeasured by LOSS is readily explained. However, we then see that modelsincorporating this effect of metallicity agree just as well. Using the sameparameters to estimate the cosmic SN Ia rate, we again find good agreement withdata up to z~2. We suggest that this degeneracy warrants more detailedexamination of host galaxy metallicities. We discuss additional implications,including for hosts of high-z SNe Ia, the SN Ia delay time distribution,super-Chandrasekhar SNe, and cosmology.\n",

Semanticsegmentation, which is an important task for element extraction, has beenwidely used in processing mass HRRSIs. However, HRRSIs often exhibit largeintraclass variance and small interclass variance due to the diversity andcomplexity of ground objects, thereby bringing great challenges to a semanticsegmentation task.

The feasibilityof our approach is demonstrated by a simulation study, using, among others,Tyler's scatter estimator, which is distribution-free within the ellipticalmodel.

Strategies for determining the dynamic tariffshould be suitably designed so that the incurred demand and supply are balancedand therefore economic efficiency is achieved. In this manuscript, we formulatea discrete time Markov Decision Process (MDP) to determine the probabilitydesired by the SMoDS platform corresponding to the acceptance rate of eachempowered passenger at each state of the system. We use Estimated Waiting Time(EWT) as the metric for the balance between demand and supply, with the goalthat EWT be regulated around a target value. We then develop a DynamicProgramming (DP) algorithm to derive the optimal policy of the MDP thatregulates EWT around the target value. Computational experiments are conductedthat demonstrate the regulation of EWT is effective, through various scenarios.The overall demonstration is carried out offline. The MDP formulation togetherwith the DP algorithm can be utilized to an online determination of the dynamictariff by integrating with our earlier works on Cumulative Prospect Theorybased passenger behavioral modeling and the AltMin dynamic routing algorithm,and form the subject of future works.\n",

However, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are inherently subject to variationsthat reduce circuit yield, increase susceptibility to noise, and severelydegrade their anticipated energy and speed benefits. Joint exploration andoptimization of CNT processing options and CNFET circuit design are required toovercome this outstanding challenge. Unfortunately, existing approaches forsuch exploration and optimization are computationally expensive, and mostlyrely on trial-and-error-based ad hoc techniques. In this paper, we present aframework that quickly evaluates the impact of CNT variations on circuit delayand noise margin, and systematically explores the large space of CNT processingoptions to derive optimized CNT processing and CNFET circuit design guidelines.We demonstrate that our framework: 1) runs over 100x faster than existingapproaches, and 2) accurately identifies the most important CNT processingparameters, together with CNFET circuit design parameters (e.g., for CNFETsizing and standard cell layouts), to minimize the impact of CNT variations onCNFET circuit speed with less than 5% energy cost, while simultaneously meetingcircuit-level noise margin and yield constraints.\n",

However,similar estimates for the error of the Galerkin projection for second-orderelliptic problems show a dependence on the maximum angle of all triangles inthe triangulation. We demonstrate on the example of a special family ofdistorted triangulations that this dependence is essential, and due to thedeterioration of the consistency error. We also provide examples of sequencesof triangulations such that the nonconforming P1 Galerkin projections for aPoisson problem with polynomial solution do not converge or converge atarbitrarily slow speed.

Our results provide the firstexperimental demonstration of axonal AP initiation without high axonal channeldensity and suggest that increasing the bandwidth of the neuronal code andhence the computational efficiency of network function was a major benefit ofthe evolution of the AIS.\n",

In otherwords, we define gauge invariant quantum fields which are used to build theaction. In that framework, the Higgs field is not necessarily a physical degreeof freedom but can merely be a dressing field that does not propagate. If theHiggs boson is not propagating, the weak interactions must become stronglycoupled below 1 TeV and have a non-trivial fixed point and would thus berenormalizable at the non-perturbative level. On the other hand, if a gaugeinvariant Higgs boson is introduced in the model, its couplings to the fermionsand the electroweak bosons can be quite different from those expected in thestandard model.\n",

To investigate this effect on thecritical surface in an effective model approach, we use the Nambu-Jona-Lasiniomodel with finite Matsubara frequency summation. We find that qualitativefeature of the critical surface does not alter appreciably as we decrease thesummation number, which is unlike the case what is observed in the recentlattice QCD studies. This may either suggest the dependence of chemicalpotential on the coupling strength or due to some additional interacting termssuch as vector interactions which could play an important role at finitedensity.\n",

Interactions between agents occurthrough their dynamic, which depends on the distribution of all agents.  We start by considering the associated optimal control problem, showing thatsemi-concavity in space of the corresponding value function can be obtained byrequiring as time regularity only a lower Lipschitz bound on the dynamics. Wealso prove differentiability of the value function along optimal trajectoriesunder extra regularity assumptions.  We then provide a Lagrangian formulation for our mean field game and useclassical techniques to prove existence of equilibria, which are shown tosatisfy a MFG system. Our main result, which relies on the semi-concavity ofthe value function, states that an absolutely continuous initial distributionof agents with an $L^p$ density gives rise to an absolutely continuousdistribution of agents at all positive times with a uniform bound on its $L^p$norm. This is also used to prove existence of equilibria under fewer regularityassumptions on the dynamics thanks to a limit argument.\n",

Here, we report that high-quality monolayer boron nitride (BN) hasa thermal conductivity (\\k{appa}) of 751 W/mK at room temperature. Thoughsmaller than that of graphene, this value is larger than that of cubic boronnitride (cBN) and only second to those of diamond and lately discovered cubicboron arsenide (BAs). Monolayer BN has the second largest \\k{appa} per unitweight among all semiconductors and insulators, just behind diamond, if densityis considered. The \\k{appa} of atomically thin BN decreases with increasedthickness. Our large-scale molecular dynamic simulations using Green-Kuboformalism accurately reproduce this trend, and the density functional theory(DFT) calculations reveal the main scattering mechanism. The thermal expansioncoefficients (TECs) of monolayer to trilayer BN at 300-400 K are alsoexperimentally measured, and the results are comparable to atomistic ab initioDFT calculations in a wider range of temperatures. Thanks to its wide bandgap,high thermal conductivity, outstanding strength, good flexibility, andexcellent thermal and chemical stability, atomically thin BN is a strongcandidate for heat dissipation applications, especially in the next generationof flexible electronic devices.\n",

Previous works have demonstrated the conservativeness of theinverse of the product of the fresh leaf density and thickness, the so-calledHughes constant, K. We use this fact to develop LAMM, an absolute method of LAmeasurement, i.e. no regression fits or prior calibrations with planimeters.Nor does it require drying the leaves. The concept involves the in situdetermination of K using geometrical shapes and their weights obtained from asubset of fresh leaves of the set whose areas are desired. Subsequently theLAs, at any desired stratification level, are derived by utilizing K and thepreviously measured masses of the fresh leaves. The concept was first tested inthe simulated ideal case of complete planarity and uniform thickness by usingplastic film covered card-paper sheets. Next the species-specificconservativeness of K over individual leaf zones and different leaf types fromleaves of plants from two species, Mandevilla splendens and Spathiphyllumwallisii, was quantitatively validated. Using the global average K values, theLA of these and additional plants, were obtained. LAMM was found to be a rapid,simple, economic technique with accuracies, as measured for the geometricalshapes, that were comparable to those obtained by the planimetric method thatutilizes digital image analysis, DIA. For the leaves themselves, there were nostatistically significant differences between the LAs measured by LAMM and bythe DIA and the linear correlation between the two methods was excellent.\n",

Superradiance and subradiance effectsare observed over distances comparable to the operating wavelength insideplasmonic nanochannels. These plasmonic waveguides can provide an effectiveepsilon-near-zero operation in their cut-off frequency and Fabry-Perotresonances at higher frequencies. The related plasmonic resonant modes arefound to efficiently enhance the constructive (superradiance) or destructive(subradiance) interference between different quantum emitters located insidethe waveguides. By increasing the number of emitters located in the elongatedplasmonic channel, the superradiance effect is enhanced at theepsilon-near-zero operation, leading to a strong coherent increase in thecollective spontaneous emission rate. In addition, the separation distancebetween neighboring emitters and their emission wavelengths can be changed todynamically control the collective emission properties of the plasmonic system.It is envisioned that the dynamic modification between quantum superradiant andsubradiant modes will find applications in quantum entanglement of qubits,low-threshold nanolasers and efficient sensors.\n",

HESS J1641-463 remained unnoticed by the usual analysistechniques due to confusion with the bright nearby source HESS J1640-465. Itemerged at a significance level of 8.5 standard deviations after restrictingthe analysis to events with energies above 4 TeV. It shows a moderate fluxlevel of F(E > 1 TeV) = (3.64 +/- 0.44_stat +/- 0.73_sys) x 10^-13 cm^-2s-1,corresponding to 1.8% of the Crab Nebula flux above the same energy, and a hardspectrum with a photon index of Gamma = 2.07 +/- 0.11_stat +/- 0.20_sys. It isa point-like source, although an extension up to Gaussian width of sigma = 3arcmin cannot be discounted due to uncertainties in the H.E.S.S. PSF. The VHEgamma-ray flux of HESS J1641-463 is found to be constant over the observedperiod when checking time binnings from year-by-year to the 28 min exposurestimescales. HESS J1641-463 is positionally coincident with the radio supernovaremnant SNR G338.5+0.1. No X-ray candidate stands out as a clear association,however Chandra and XMM-Newton data reveal some potential weak counterparts.Various VHE gamma-ray production scenarios are discussed. If the emission fromHESS J1641-463 is produced by cosmic ray protons colliding with the ambientgas, then their spectrum must extend close to 1 PeV.

A proxy for grain size is used to modulate theexternal dimensions of the plot to mimic profiles seen in real outcrops.

In the case of measurements from wirelinemicroresistivity tools, whose circumferential coverage is substantially lessthan 100%, the missing circumferential data is first inpainted using multiscaledirectional transforms, which decompose the image into its elemental buildingstructures, before reconstructing the full image.

The jets,originated from the well-connected active region (AR 10939) whose magneticpolarity structure favors the eruption, are observed to be forming in a coronalsite, extending to a few solar radii, and having a good temporal correlationwith the electron solar release. The open-field lines near the jet site arerooted in a negative polarity, along which energetic particles escape from theflaring AR to the near-Earth space, consistent with the in situ electron pitchangle distribution. The analysis enables us to propose a coronal magnetictopology relating the impulsive SEP events to their solar source.\n",

The evolution of the closed string is envisaged on theworldsheet in the presence of its massless excitations. The duality symmetry isstudied when some of the spacial coordinates are compactified on d-dimensionaltorus, $T^d$. The known results are reviewed to elucidate that equations ofmotion for the compact coordinates are $O(d,d)$ covariant, $d$ being the numberof compact directions. Next, the vertex operators of excited massive levels areconsidered in a simple compactification scheme. It is shown that the vertexoperators for each massive level can be cast in a T-duality invariant form insuch a case. Subsequently, the duality properties of superstring isinvestigated in the NSR formulation for the massless backgrounds such asgraviton and antisymmetric tensor. The worldsheet superfield formulation isfound to be very suitable for our purpose. The Hassan-Sen compactification isadopted and it is shown that the worldsheet equations of motion for compactsuperfields to be very suitable for our purpose. The Hassan-Sencompactification is adopted and it is shown that the worldsheet equations ofmotion for compact superfields are $O(d,d)$ covariant when the backgrounds areindependent of superfields along compact directions. The vertex operators forexcited levels are presented in the NS-NS sector and it is shown that they canbe cast in T-duality invariant form for the case of Hassan-Sen compactificationscheme.

Besides theoriginal model of Dingle [Phys. Rev. Lett. 23, 579 (1969)], two othermechanisms were recently proposed. We report an analysis of the opticalproperties of Cu in ZnO by ab initio calculations. The GGA+U approach is used,with the +U corrections applied to d(Zn), p(O) and d(Cu) orbitals. The results,compared with the available experimental data, support the Dingle's model, inwhich the SGL originates in the (Cu1+, hole) --> Cu2+ transition. A goodagreement with experiment is obtained also for the internal transition at 0.72eV. The absence of an expected radiative transition at about 2 eV is explainedby its quasi-forbidden character.\n",

SMM J04135+10277 was previouslythought to be a gas-rich, submillimeter-selected quasar, with the highestmolecular gas mass among high-z quasars reported in the literature. Our maps at~6x improved linear resolution relative to earlier observations spatiallyresolve the emission on ~1.7\" scales, corresponding to a (lensing-corrected)source radius of ~5.2 kpc. They also reveal that the molecular gas reservoir,and thus, likely the submillimeter emission, is not associated with the hostgalaxy of the quasar, but with an optically faint gas-rich galaxy at 5.2\", or41.5 kpc projected distance from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Theobscured gas-rich galaxy has a dynamical mass of M_dyn sin2(i)=5.6x10^11 M_sun,corresponding to a gas mass fraction of ~21%. Assuming a typical M_BH/M* ratiofor z>2 quasars, the two galaxies in this system have an approximate mass ratioof ~1.9. Our findings suggest that this quasar-starburst galaxy pair couldrepresent an early stage of a rare major, gas-rich/gas-poor (\"wet-dry\") mergerof two massive galaxies at z=2.8, rather than a single, gas-rich AGN hostgalaxy. Such systems could play an important role in the early buildup ofpresent-day massive galaxies through a submillimeter-luminous starburst phase,and may remain hidden in larger numbers among rest-frame far-infrared-selectedquasar samples at low and high redshift.\n",

(Bensmail, Merker, Thomassen: Decomposing graphs intoa constant number of locally irregular subgraphs, {\\em European J. Combin.},60:124--134, 2017) settled the first constant upper bound for the problem to$328$ colors. In this paper, using a combination of existing results, wepresent an improvement of the bounds for bipartite graphs and general graphs,setting the best upper bounds to $7$ and $220$, respectively. In addition, wealso prove that $4$ colors suffice for locally irregular edge-coloring of anysubcubic graph.\n",

Not many processes in this class that are capable of targetingarbitrary invariant distributions are currently known, and within one subclassall previously known processes utilize linear transition functions. In thiswork, we derive a process whose transition function is nonlinear throughsolving its Fokker-Planck equation in hyperspherical coordinates. We exploreits behavior on Gaussian targets, as well as a Bayesian logistic regressionmodel with synthetic data. We discuss implications to both the theory ofpiecewise deterministic Markov processes, and to Bayesian statisticians as wellas physicists seeking to use them for simulation-based computation.\n",

To better capture the moving objects in videos, we introduce dynamicpoints. We use them to model dynamic motions by using a forward-backwardextractor to keep temporal consistency and using image reconstruction to keepspatial consistency in an unsupervised manner. Then we aggregate dynamic pointsto instance points, which stand for moving objects such as pedestrians invideos. Finally, we extract trajectories by matching instance points forprediction training. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first toachieve unsupervised learning of trajectory extraction and prediction. Weevaluate the performance on well-known trajectory datasets and show that ourmethod is effective for real-world videos and can use raw videos to furtherimprove the performance of existing models.\n",

High resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) and atomic forcemicroscopy (AFM) confirmed good crystal quality and surface morphology of thesubstrates. The electrical properties of both devices, includingcurrent-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics, werecomprehensively measured and compared. The (-201) and (010) SBDs exhibitedon-resistances (Ron) of 0.56 and 0.77 m{\\Omega}cm2, turn-on voltages (Von) of1.0 and 1.3 V, Schottky barrier heights (SBH) of 1.05 and 1.20 eV, electronmobilities of 125 and 65 cm2/(Vs), respectively, with a high on-current of ~1.3kA/cm2 and on/off ratio of ~109. The (010) SBD had a larger Von and SBH than(-201) SBD due to anisotropic surface properties (i.e., surface Fermi levelpinning and band bending), as supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) measurements. Temperature-dependent I-V also revealed the inhomogeneousnature of the SBH in both devices, where (-201) SBD showed a more uniform SBHdistribution. The homogeneous SBH was also extracted: 1.33 eV for (-201) SBDand 1.53 eV for (010) SBD. The reverse leakage current of the devices was welldescribed by the two-step trap-assisted tunneling model and the one-dimensionalvariable range hopping conduction (1D-VRH) model. The (-201) SBD showed largerleakage current due to its lower SBH and smaller activation energy. Theseresults indicate the crystalline anisotropy of beta-Ga2O3 can affect theelectrical properties of vertical SBDs and should be taken into considerationwhen designing beta-Ga2O3 electronics.\n",

      "Abstract:   Sensory neurons are often described in terms of a receptive field, that is, alinear kernel through which stimuli are filtered before they are furtherprocessed. If information transmission is assumed to proceed in a feedforwardcascade, the receptive field may be interpreted as the external stimulus'profile maximizing neuronal output. The nervous system, however, contains manyfeedback loops, and sensory neurons filter more currents than the onesrepresenting the transduced external stimulus. Some of the additional currentsare generated by the output activity of the neuron itself, and thereforeconstitute feedback signals. By means of a time-frequency analysis of theinput/output transformation, here we show how feedback modifies the receptivefield. The model is applicable to various types of feedback processes, fromspike triggered intrinsic conductances to inhibitory synaptic inputs fromnearby neurons. We distinguish between the intrinsic receptive field (filteringall input currents) and the effective receptive field (filtering only externalstimuli). Whereas the intrinsic receptive field summarizes the biophysicalproperties of the neuron associated to subthreshold integration and spikegeneration, only the effective receptive field can be interpreted as theexternal stimulus' profile maximizing neuronal output. We demonstrate thatspike-triggered feedback shifts low-pass filtering towards band-passprocessing, transforming integrator neurons into resonators. For strongfeedback, a sharp resonance in the spectral neuronal selectivity may appear.Our results provide a unified framework to interpret a collection of previousexperimental studies where specific feedback mechanisms were shown to modifythe filtering properties of neurons.\n",

With the popularity of convolutional neural networks(CNNs), computer-aided diagnosis of cancer has attracted considerableattention. Such tools are easily deployable and are cost-effective. Hence,these can enable extensive coverage of cancer diagnostic facilities. However,the development of such a tool for ALL cancer was challenging so far due to thenon-availability of a large training dataset. The visual similarity between themalignant and normal cells adds to the complexity of the problem. This paperdiscusses the recent release of a large dataset and presents a novel deeplearning architecture for the classification of cell images of ALL cancer. Theproposed architecture, namely, SDCT-AuxNet$^{\\theta}$ is a 2-module frameworkthat utilizes a compact CNN as the main classifier in one module and a KernelSVM as the auxiliary classifier in the other one. While CNN classifier usesfeatures through bilinear-pooling, spectral-averaged features are used by theauxiliary classifier. Further, this CNN is trained on the stain deconvolvedquantity images in the optical density domain instead of the conventional RGBimages. A novel test strategy is proposed that exploits both the classifiersfor decision making using the confidence scores of their predicted classlabels. Elaborate experiments have been carried out on our recently releasedpublic dataset of 15114 images of ALL cancer and healthy cells to establish thevalidity of the proposed methodology that is also robust to subject-levelvariability. A weighted F1 score of 94.8$\\%$ is obtained that is best so far onthis challenging dataset.\n",

It is shown that the unification of gauge couplingsinto a unique coupling constant can be achieved at a high-energy scalecompatible with proton decay constraints. This requires the addition of aminimal particle content at intermediate energy scales. In particular, theintroduction of the SU(2)_L triplets belonging to the (15,1)+(\\bar{15},1)representations, as well as of the scalar triplet \\Sigma_3 and octet \\Sigma_8in the (24,1) representation, turns out to be crucial for unification. Themasses of these intermediate particles can vary over a wide range, and even liein the TeV region. In contrast, the exotic vector-like fermions must be heavyenough and have masses above 10^10 GeV. We also show that, if the SU(5)xSU(5)theory is embedded into a heterotic string scenario, it is not possible toachieve gauge coupling unification with gravity at the perturbative stringscale.\n",

Weobtain an analytical expression for the baryon binding energy . In that case weplot the baryon binding energy in terms of radial coordinate. Then by using thebinding energy diagram, we determine the stability range for baryonconfiguration. And also the position and energy of the stable equilibrium pointis obtained by the corresponding diagram. Also we plot the baryon bindingenergy in terms of temperature and estimate a critical temperature in which thebaryon would be dissociated.\n",

      "Abstract:   Compared to conforming P1 finite elements, nonconforming P1 finite elementdiscretizations are thought to be less sensitive to the appearance of distortedtriangulations. E.g., optimal-order discrete $H^1$ norm best approximationerror estimates for $H^2$ functions hold for arbitrary triangulations. However,similar estimates for the error of the Galerkin projection for second-orderelliptic problems show a dependence on the maximum angle of all triangles inthe triangulation. We demonstrate on the example of a special family ofdistorted triangulations that this dependence is essential, and due to thedeterioration of the consistency error. We also provide examples of sequencesof triangulations such that the nonconforming P1 Galerkin projections for aPoisson problem with polynomial solution do not converge or converge atarbitrarily slow speed. The results complement analogous findings forconforming P1 elements.\n",

Active attackers create fake accounts to buildstructural patterns in social graphs which can be used to re-identifylegitimate users on published anonymised graphs, even without additionalbackground knowledge. So far, this type of attacks has only been studied in thescenario where the inherently dynamic social graph is published once. In thispaper, we present the first active re-identification attack in the morerealistic scenario where a dynamic social graph is periodically published. Thenew attack leverages tempo-structural patterns for strengthening the adversary.Through a comprehensive set of experiments on real-life and synthetic dynamicsocial graphs, we show that our new attack substantially outperforms the mosteffective static active attack in the literature by increasing the successprobability of re-identification by more than two times and efficiency byalmost 10 times. Moreover, unlike the static attack, our new attack is able toremain at the same level of effectiveness and efficiency as the publicationprocess advances. We conduct a study on the factors that may thwart our newattack, which can help design graph anonymising methods with a better balancebetween privacy and utility.\n",

A particular strategy is devised toensure capture into an uncontrolled relatively stable orbit at the Moon. Bothuncertainty in the orbit determination process and in the control of the thrustvector are included in the navigation analysis. The orbit determination processis based on the definition of an optimal filtering technique that is able tomeet accuracy requirements at an acceptable computational cost. Threesequential filtering techniques are analysed: an extended Kalman filter, anUnscented Kalman filter and a Kalman filter based on high order expansions. Theanalysis shows that only the unscented Kalman filter meets the accuracyrequirements at an acceptable computational cost. This paper demonstrates lunarweak capture for all trajectories within a capture corridor defined by all thetrajectories in the neighbourhood of the nominal one, in state space. A minimumf'v strategy is presented to extend the lifetime of the spacecraft around theMoon. The orbit determination and navigation strategies are applied to the caseof the European Student Moon Orbiter.\n",

The study of such a system is conductedin order to understand energy dissipation resulting from the shallow watersloshing and induced wave breaking. This analysis is relevant for the design ofTuned Liquid Damper devices. The complexity and violence of the flow generatedby the roll motion results in the impossibility of using an analyticalapproach, requiring in turn the use of a suitable numerical solver. In Part I,the coupled dynamical system is thoroughly described, revealing its nonlinearfeatures associated with the large amplitude of the forcing, both in terms ofmechanical and fluid dynamical aspects. A smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)model, largely validated in literature, is used to calculate the frequencybehavior of the whole system. For small rotation angles, a semi-analyticalmodel of the energy dissipated by the fluid, based on a hydraulic jumpsolution, is developed; the energy transfer is numerically calculated in orderto extend the analysis to large oscillation angles.

These gains come at a cost of increasedinterference, specifically the cross network interference between the macrocelland femtocell networks. This interference is one of the main performancelimiting factors in allowing an underlaid femtocell network to share thespectrum with the cellular network. To manage this interference, we firstpropose a femtocell architecture that orthog- onally partitions the networkbandwidth between the macrocell and femtocell networks. This scheme eliminatesthe cross network interference thus giving the femtocells more freedom overtheir use of the spectrum. Specifically, no interference constraint is imposedby the cellular network allowing femto users to transmit at a constant power onrandomly selected channels. Although simple, this scheme is enough to givegains up to 200% in sum rate.  We then propose a second architecture where both networks share the bandwidthsimultaneously. A femtocell power control scheme that relies on minimalcoordination with the macrocell base station is used in conjunction with aninterference sensing channel assignment mechanism. These two schemes togetheryield sum rate gains up to 200%. We then develop a technique for macro users tojoin a nearby femtocell and share a common chan- nel with a femtocell userthrough the use of successive interfer- ence cancellation. By adding thismechanism to the power control and channel assignment schemes, we show sum rategains over 300% and up to 90% power savings for macrocell users.\n",

      "Abstract:   We discuss the thermodynamics of recently constructed three-dimensionalhigher spin black holes in SL(N,R)\\times SL(N,R) Chern-Simons theory withgeneralized asymptotically-anti-de Sitter boundary conditions. From aholographic perspective, these bulk theories are dual to two-dimensional CFTswith W_N symmetry algebras, and the black hole solutions are dual to thermalstates with higher spin chemical potentials and charges turned on. Because thenotion of horizon area is not gauge-invariant in the higher spin theory, thetraditional approaches to the computation of black hole entropy must bereconsidered. One possibility, explored in the recent literature, involvesdemanding the existence of a partition function in the CFT, and consistencywith the first law of thermodynamics. This approach is not free fromambiguities, however, and in particular different definitions of energy resultin different expressions for the entropy. In the present work we show thatthere are natural definitions of the thermodynamically conjugate variables thatfollow from careful examination of the variational principle, and moreoveragree with those obtained via canonical methods. Building on this intuition, wederive general expressions for the higher spin black hole entropy and freeenergy which are written entirely in terms of the Chern-Simons connections, andare valid for both static and rotating solutions. We compare our results toother proposals in the literature, and provide a new and efficient way todetermine the generalization of the Cardy formula to a situation with higherspin charges.\n",

The liquidus of a mantlewith Mg# (=100*(Mg/(Mg+Fe))) 80 is ~1625oC and, under equilibrium conditionsthe melt crystallises olivine alone until it is joined by orthopyroxene at1350oC. We synthesized melt from our 1350oC experiment and simulated itsfractional crystallization path. Orthopyroxene crystallizes until it isreplaced by pigeonite at 1200oC. Liquids become eucritic and crystalassemblages resemble diogenites below 1250oC. MELTS correctly predicts theolivine liquidus but overestimates the orthopyroxene liquidus by ~70oC.Predicted melt compositions are in reasonable agreement with those generatedexperimentally.

Although saliencydetection is well explored for 2D image and video content, there are only fewattempts made to design 3D saliency prediction models. Newly proposed 3D visualattention models have to be validated over large-scale video saliencyprediction datasets, which also contain results of eye-tracking information.There are several publicly available eye-tracking datasets for 2D image andvideo content. In the case of 3D, however, there is still a need forlarge-scale video saliency datasets for the research community for validatingdifferent 3D-VAMs. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset containingeye-tracking data collected from 61 stereoscopic 3D videos (and also 2Dversions of those) and 24 subjects participated in a free-viewing test. Weevaluate the performance of the existing saliency detection methods over theproposed dataset.

Detection or upper limits on the faint afterglowfrom GRBs or other sources at cosmological distances are important means ofconstraining the source modeling.  Using the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT), we compare the sensitivity androbustness of three methods applied to the detection of faint radio sourcesfrom raster maps around a known source position: the smart quick-look method,the source extraction method (typical of high-energy astronomy), and the fitwith a 2-D Gaussian. We developed a Python code specific for the analysis ofpoint-like radio sources applied to the SRT C-band (6.9 GHz) observations ofboth undetected sources (GRB afterglows of 181201A and 190114C) and thedetected Galactic X-ray binary GRS 1915+105.  Our comparative analysis of the different detection methods made extensiveuse of simulations as a useful complement to actual radio observations. Thebest method for the SRT data analysis is the fit with a 2-D Gaussian, as itpushes down the sensitivity limits of single-dish observations -- with respectto more traditional techniques -- to ~ 1.8 mJy, improving by ~ 40 % comparedwith the initial value. This analysis shows that -- especially for faintsources -- good maps of the scanned region pre- or post-outburst are essential.\n",

      "Abstract:   Autonomous driving system development is critically dependent on the abilityto replay complex and diverse traffic scenarios in simulation. In suchscenarios, the ability to accurately simulate the vehicle sensors such ascameras, lidar or radar is essential. However, current sensor simulatorsleverage gaming engines such as Unreal or Unity, requiring manual creation ofenvironments, objects and material properties. Such approaches have limitedscalability and fail to produce realistic approximations of camera, lidar, andradar data without significant additional work.  In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach to generaterealistic scenario sensor data, based only on a limited amount of lidar andcamera data collected by an autonomous vehicle. Our approach usestexture-mapped surfels to efficiently reconstruct the scene from an initialvehicle pass or set of passes, preserving rich information about object 3Dgeometry and appearance, as well as the scene conditions. We then leverage aSurfelGAN network to reconstruct realistic camera images for novel positionsand orientations of the self-driving vehicle and moving objects in the scene.We demonstrate our approach on the Waymo Open Dataset and show that it cansynthesize realistic camera data for simulated scenarios. We also create anovel dataset that contains cases in which two self-driving vehicles observethe same scene at the same time. We use this dataset to provide additionalevaluation and demonstrate the usefulness of our SurfelGAN model.\n",

We find that the electric current saturateat a high electric field, in agreement with experiment. The saturation currentdepends weakly on the temperature, which we attribute to the \"quantum\" frictionbetween the graphene carriers and the substrate optical phonons. We calculatethe frictional drag between two graphene sheets caused by van der Waalsfriction, and find that this drag can induce a high enough voltage which can beeasily measured experimentally. We find that for nonsuspended graphene thenear-field radiative heat transfer, and the heat transfer due to directphononic coupling, are of the same order of magnitude at low electric field.The phononic contribution to the heat transfer dominates at high field.

      "\n",
      "Abstract:   Redundancy scheduling has emerged as a powerful strategy for improvingresponse times in parallel-server systems. The key feature in redundancyscheduling is replication of a job upon arrival by dispatching replicas todifferent servers. Redundant copies are abandoned as soon as the first of thesereplicas finishes service. By creating multiple service opportunities,redundancy scheduling increases the chance of a fast response from a serverthat is quick to provide service, and mitigates the risk of a long delayincurred when a single selected server turns out to be slow.  The diversity enabled by redundant requests has been found to stronglyimprove the response time performance, especially in case of highly variableservice requirements. Analytical results for redundancy scheduling areunfortunately scarce however, and even the stability condition has largelyremained elusive so far, except for exponentially distributed servicerequirements. In order to gain further insight in the role of the servicerequirement distribution, we explore the behavior of redundancy scheduling forscaled Bernoulli service requirements. We establish a sufficient stabilitycondition for generally distributed service requirements and we show that, forscaled Bernoulli service requirements, this condition is also asymptoticallynearly necessary. This stability condition differs drastically from theexponential case, indicating that the stability condition depends on theservice requirements in a sensitive and intricate manner.\n",

These asymmetries are most prominent in loop footpointregions, where a clear correlation of the asymmetry with the Doppler shift andline width determined from the single Gaussian fit is found. Such asymmetriessuggest at least two emission components: a primary component accounting forthe background emission and a secondary component associated with high-speedupflows. The latter has been proposed to play a vital role in the coronalheating process and there is no agreement on its properties. Here we slightlymodify the initially developed technique of Red-Blue (RB) asymmetry analysisand apply it to both artificial spectra and spectra observed by the EUV ImagingSpectrometer onboard Hinode, and demonstrate that the secondary componentusually contributes a few percent of the total emission, has a velocity rangingfrom 50 to 150 km s-1 and a Gaussian width comparable to that of the primaryone in loop footpoint regions. The results of the RB asymmetry analysis arethen used to guide a double Gaussian fit and we find that the obtainedproperties of the secondary component are generally consistent with thoseobtained from the RB asymmetry analysis. Through a comparison of the location,relative intensity, and velocity distribution of the blueward secondarycomponent with the properties of the upward propagating disturbances revealedin simultaneous images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the SolarDynamics Observatory, we find a clear association of the secondary componentwith the propagating disturbances.\n",

      "Abstract:   It has been shown that truncated cone-shaped cavities with microwavesresonating within them move slightly towards their narrow ends (the emdrive).Standard physics has no explanation for this and an error has not yet beenfound. It is shown here that this effect can be predicted by assuming that theinertial mass of the photons in the cavity is caused by Unruh radiation, whosewavelengths must fit exactly within the cavity, using a theory already appliedsuccessfully to astrophysical anomalies such as galaxy rotation where the Unruhwaves have to fit within the Hubble scale. In the emdrive this means that moreUnruh waves are allowed at the wide end, leading to a greater inertial mass forthe photons there, and to conserve momentum the cavity must move towards itsnarrow end, as observed. The model predicts thrusts of: 3.8, 149, 7.3, 0.23,0.57, 0.11, 0.64 and 0.02 mN compared with the observed thrusts of: 16, 147, 9,0.09, 0.05, 0.06, 0.03, and 0.02 mN and predicts that if the axial length isequal to the diameter of the small end of the cavity, the thrust should bereversed.\n",

For each pair of locations, a distance isspecified and for each pair of facilities a weight or flow is specified (e.g.,the amount of supplies transported between the two facilities). The problem isto assign all facilities to different locations with the aim of minimizing thesum of the distances multiplied by the corresponding flows. The QAP is amongthe most difficult NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Because ofthis, this paper presents an efficient Genetic algorithm (GA) to solve thisproblem in reasonable time. For validation the proposed GA some examples areselected from QAP library. The obtained results in reasonable time show theefficiency of proposed GA.\n",

Montanaro in order to solve problems in thetheory of quantum XOR games. Here, among other results, we obtain new upperbounds for the Bohnenblust-Hille constants in the case of complex scalars. Forbilinear forms, we obtain the optimal constants of variants of Littlewood's 4/3inequality (in the case of real scalars) when the exponent 4/3 is replaced byany $r\\geq4/3.$ As a consequence of our estimates we show that the optimalconstants for the real case are always strictly greater than the constants forthe complex case.\n",

By way of analysing a model problem of flow through a narrowparallel plate channel, we show that the temperature gradients have asignificant effect on the streaming potential, and, consequently, on the flowitself. We incorporate thermoelectric effects in our model by a full-fledgedcoupling among the electric potential, the ionic species distribution, thefluid velocity and the local fluid temperature fields without resorting to adhoc simplifications.

In this paper, we focus on pages withlocal defects including gray spots and solid spots. We propose a coarse-to-finemethod to detect local defects in a block-wise manner, and aggregate theblockwise attributes to generate the feature vector of the whole test page fora further ranking task. In the detection part, we first select candidateregions by thresholding a single feature. Then more detailed features ofcandidate blocks are calculated and sent to a decision tree that is previouslytrained on our training dataset.

In both cases the predicted productionrates for the CP-even (odd) states render up to 10^4 (10^3) events per 500\\invfb of integrated luminosity, in full consistency with all the theoreticaland phenomenological constraints. Depending on the channel the maximum ratescan be larger or smaller than the SM expectations, but in most of the parameterspace they should be well measurable. We analyze how these departures depend onthe dynamics underlying each of the models, supersymmetric andnon-supersymmetric, and highlight the possible distinctive phenomenologicalsignatures. We demonstrate that this process could be extremely helpful todiscern non-supersymmetric Higgs bosons from supersymmetric ones.

However, its dynamics are complexand often difficult to understand. This paper presents an agent-based model ofurban settlement, agglomeration, displacement, and sprawl. New settlements formaround a spatial amenity that draws initial, poor settlers to subsist on theresource. As the settlement grows, subsequent settlers of varying income,skills, and interests are heterogeneously drawn to either the original amenityor to the emerging human agglomeration. As this agglomeration grows anddensifies, land values increase, and the initial poor settlers are displacedfrom the spatial amenity on which they relied. Through path dependence,high-income residents remain clustered around this original amenity for whichthey have no direct use or interest. This toy model explores these dynamics,demonstrating a simplified mechanism of how urban displacement andgentrification can be sensitive to income inequality, density, and variedpreferences for different types of amenities.\n",

Thesesystems are driven by dissipative systems, which lead to fractal assembly and afractal network of charges (with associated quantum potentials) at themolecular scale. At critical levels of charge density and fractal dimension,individual quantum potentials merge to form a charged induced macroscopicquantum potential, which act as a structuring force dictating long range order.Whilst the system is only partially coherent (i.e. only the bosonic fields arecoherent), within these processes many of the phenomena associated withstandard quantum theory are recovered, with macroscopic quantum potentials andassociated forces having their equivalence in standard quantum mechanics. Weestablish a testable hypothesis that the development of structures analogous tothose found in biological systems, which exhibit macroscopic quantumproperties, should lead to increased critical temperatures in high temperaturesuperconducting materials. If the theory is confirmed it opens up a new,systematic, ab initio approach to the structural development of these types ofmaterials.\n",

      "Abstract:   Numerical schemes provably preserving the positivity of density and pressureare highly desirable for MHD, but the rigorous positivity-preserving (PP)analysis remains challenging. The difficulties mainly arise from the intrinsiccomplexity of the MHD equations as well as the indeterminate relation betweenthe PP property and the divergence-free condition on magnetic field. We presentthe first rigorous PP analysis of conservative schemes with Lax-Friedrichs (LF)flux for ideal MHD. The significant innovation is the discovery of theoreticalconnection between PP property and a discrete divergence-free (DDF) condition.This connection is established through the generalized LF splitting properties,which are alternatives of the usually-expected LF splitting property that doesnot hold for ideal MHD. The generalized LF splitting properties involve anumber of admissible states strongly coupled by DDF condition, making theirderivation very difficult. We derive these properties via a novel equivalentform of the admissible state set and an important inequality skillfullyconstructed by technical estimates. Rigorous PP analysis is presented forfinite volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes with LF flux on uniformCartesian meshes. In 1D case, PP property is proved for the first-order schemewith proper numerical viscosity, and also for arbitrarily high-order schemesunder conditions accessible by a PP limiter. In 2D case, we show that the DDFcondition is necessary and crucial for achieving PP property. It is observedthat even slightly violating the proposed DDF condition may cause failure topreserve the positivity of pressure. We prove that the 2D LF type scheme withproper numerical viscosity preserves the positivity and DDF condition.Sufficient conditions are derived for 2D PP high-order schemes, and extensionto 3D is discussed. Numerical examples confirm the theoretical findings.\n",
